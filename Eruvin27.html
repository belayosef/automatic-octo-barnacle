Daf 27a<br><br><b>since he can interpose</b> between himself and the graves <b>and go and eat</b> the food that comprises the <i>eiruv</i> without contracting ritual impurity.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may not learn from general statements,</b> i.e., when a general statement is made in a mishna using the word all, it is not to be understood as an all-inclusive, general statement without exceptions. This is true <b>even in a place where it says</b> the word <b>except.</b> Even in that case, there may be other exceptions to the rule that are not listed.<br>The Gemara notes: <b>From</b> the fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said: Even in a place where it says except,</b> this proves <b>by inference that he was not relating to</b> the general statement made <b>here</b> in the mishna, which uses the word except. <b>To which</b> mishna, then, <b>was he relating</b> when he formulated his principle?<br>The Gemara answers: <b>He was relating</b> to a mishna found <b>there:</b> With regard to <b>all time-bound, positive commandments,</b> i.e., mitzvot that can only be performed at a certain time of the day, or during the day rather than at night, or on certain days of the year, <b>men are obligated</b> to perform them <b>and women are exempt.</b> But positive commandments <b>that are not time-bound, both women and men are obligated</b> to perform.<br><b>Is it</b> a general <b>principle</b> that <b>women are exempt from all time-bound, positive commandments</b> without exception? But <b>there is</b> the commandment to eat <b><i>matza</i></b> on Passover, the commandment of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival, and the commandment of <b>assembly</b> in the Temple courtyard once every seven years during the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> following the Sabbatical Year, all of which <b>are time-bound, positive commandments, and</b> nevertheless, <b>women are obligated</b> to perform them.<br>Similarly, <b>are women obligated in all positive commandments that are not time-bound?</b> But <b>there is</b> the commandment of <b>Torah study,</b> the commandment to <b>be fruitful and multiply,</b> and the commandment of <b>redemption of the firstborn,</b> all of which are <b>positive commandments that are not time-bound, and</b> nevertheless, <b>women are exempt</b> from them. <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may not learn from general statements, even in a place where it says except,</b> because it is always possible that there other exceptions to the rule.<br><b>Abaye said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> who said: <b>We, too, have also learned</b> a proof for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s principle from a mishna: <b>They stated</b> yet <b>another</b> general <b>principle: Anything</b> that is <b>carried upon a <i>zav</i> is</b> ritually <b>impure. And anything on which a <i>zav</i> is carried is</b> ritually <b>pure, except for</b> an object <b>suitable for lying or sitting upon and a human being,</b> which become defiled if a <i>zav</i> is borne on them. The following objection may be raised: <b>And is there nothing else? But there is</b> an object upon which a person <b>rides</b> that becomes impure, as explained in the Torah itself.<br>The Gemara first asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of an object upon which <b>one rides? If he sat upon it, it is a seat.</b> If not, how does it become defiled? What is there that is suitable for riding upon but does not fall into the category of something upon which one lies or sits? The Gemara answers: <b>We say as follows: There is the upper part of a saddle,</b> which becomes ritually impure as a riding accessory and not as a regular seat. <b>As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A saddle</b> upon which a <i>zav</i> sat <b>is impure</b> as <b>a seat</b> of a <i>zav</i>, <b>and the pommel,</b> which is attached to the front of the saddle and used by the rider to maintain his position or to assist in mounting, <b>is impure</b> as <b>a riding</b> accessory. Therefore, we see that the general statement found in the mishna omits that which is suitable for riding upon. <b>Rather, conclude from this</b> that <b>one may not learn from general statements, even in a place where it says except.</b><br><b>Ravina said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman</b> who said: <b>We, too, have also learned</b> a proof for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s principle from the mishna, which states: <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> and merge</b> alleyways <b>with all</b> kinds of food, <b>except for water and salt. And is there nothing else? But there are truffles and mushrooms,</b> which also may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i> because they are not regarded as food. <b>Rather, conclude from this</b> that <b>one may not learn from general statements, even in a place where it says except.</b><br>We learned in the mishna: <b>All</b> types of food <b>may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> except for water and salt. <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> both had the same tradition, but <b>one teaches</b> it <b>with regard to <i>eiruv</i>, and one teaches</b> it <b>with regard to</b> the second <b>tithe.</b><br>The Gemara elaborates: <b>One teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the issue of <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> as follows: <b>They only taught</b> that <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with water or salt in the case of <b>water by itself or salt by itself. But</b> with <b>water and salt</b> together, <b>one may</b> indeed <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b><br><b>And</b> the other <b>one teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the issue of the second <b>tithe: They only taught</b> that water or salt <b>may not be bought</b> with second-tithe money in the case of <b>water by itself or salt by itself. But water and salt</b> mixed together <b>may</b> indeed <b>be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>The one who teaches</b> this law <b>with regard to</b> the second <b>tithe, all the more so</b> would he apply it <b>to an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., he would certainly maintain that water and salt together are suitable to be used for an <i>eiruv</i>. However, according to <b>the one who teaches</b> this law <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> it applies only to an <i>eiruv</i>; <b>but with regard to</b> the second tithe, <b>no,</b> it does not apply. <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? For the second tithe, <b>we require produce,</b> as stated in the Torah, and even when water and salt are mixed together they do not have the status of produce.<br><b>When Rabbi Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he taught</b> this law <b>with regard to</b> the second <b>tithe.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish testified before Rabbi Eliezer: In Father’s house they would buy</b> fish <b>brine with</b> second-<b>tithe money. He said to him: Perhaps you only heard</b> this in a case <b>where the fish’s innards were mixed with</b> the brine. Since this mixture contains a small portion of the fish, the brine becomes significant enough to be purchased with second-tithe money. <b>And even Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish only said</b> his statement <b>with regard to brine, which is the fat of produce,</b> i.e., because a certain amount of fish fat, which itself may be purchased with second-tithe money, is mixed in with the brine; <b>but</b> a mixture of <b>water and salt</b> alone may <b>not</b> be bought with it.<br>In response to this difficulty, <b>Rav Yosef said:</b><br><br>Daf 27b<br><br>Rabbi Yitzḥak’s ruling that water and salt mixed together may be bought with second-tithe money <b>was only necessary</b> in a case <b>where one added oil to them.</b> But a mixture of water and salt alone may not be purchased with second-tithe money.<br><b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: If so, <b>let him derive</b> that the mixture may be bought with second-tithe money <b>because of the oil</b> alone. The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>No, it was necessary</b> for a case in which <b>one paid the value of the water and salt by including</b> it in the payment for the oil. Although ostensibly the money that he paid was for the oil, he added to the price of the oil in order to include payment for the water and salt that were mixed with it.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if something may not be bought with second-tithe money, <b>is one permitted</b> to buy it <b>by including</b> it in the payment for something which may be bought with second-tithe money? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and so it was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ben Bag Bag says</b> in exposition of the verse: “And you shall bestow that money on all that your heart desires, on oxen, on sheep, on wine, on strong drink, on whatever your soul requests” (Deuteronomy 14:26): <b>“On oxen” teaches that one may buy an ox</b> and include in its price payment for <b>its hide.</b> Although the hide cannot be eaten, it may be bought together with the ox, and it does not acquire the sanctity of the second tithe. <b>“On sheep” teaches that one may buy a sheep</b> and include in its price payment for <b>its fleece,</b> which is used for purposes other than eating. <b>“On wine” teaches that one may buy wine</b> and include in its price payment for <b>its jug. “On strong drink” teaches that</b> one is permitted to buy not only actual wine, but <b>one may buy</b> even <b>mead,</b> water in which grape seeds are soaked, <b>once it has fermented</b> and acquired the flavor of wine.<br>Having cited ben Bag Bag’s exposition of the verse, the Gemara continues: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whoever interprets</b> the words <b>“on oxen” for me in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag, I will carry his clothes after him into the bathhouse,</b> i.e., I will honor him to such an extent that I will be prepared to treat him as a servant treats his master.<br><b>What is the reason</b> for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s difficulty? <b>All</b> parts of the verse cited above <b>are necessary, except for</b> the expression <b>“on oxen,” which is not necessary.</b> The Gemara clarifies: For <b>what</b> purpose are all the other words <b>necessary? As, if the Torah had written</b> only <b>“on oxen,” I might have said</b> that <b>it is</b> only an <b>ox that may be bought</b> together <b>with its hide</b> with second-tithe money <b>because</b> the hide <b>is</b> an inseparable part of <b>its body,</b> and therefore it is not considered an independent entity from its flesh. <b>But</b> as for buying a <b>sheep</b> together <b>with its fleece, which is not</b> an inseparable part of <b>its body</b> because the fleece can be removed from the sheep while it is alive, you might <b>say no,</b> second-tithe money may not be spent in this manner. It was therefore necessary to state “on sheep.”<br><b>And if the Torah had</b> also <b>written “on sheep,”</b> teaching that one may buy even a sheep with second-tithe money together <b>with its fleece, I might have said</b> that it is only a sheep that may be bought together with its fleece <b>because</b> the fleece <b>is attached to it,</b> and therefore it is considered part of the animal. <b>But</b> as for buying <b>wine</b> together <b>with its jug,</b> you might <b>say no,</b> second-tithe money may not be spent this way. It was therefore necessary to state “on wine.”<br><b>And if the Torah had</b> also <b>written “on wine,”</b> indicating that one may even buy wine together with its jug with second-tithe money, <b>I might</b> still <b>have said</b> that this is <b>because</b> the jug <b>is</b> needed for the wine’s <b>preservation,</b> as there is no way to carry wine without some sort of container. <b>But</b> as for <b>mead that has fermented, which is mere acidity,</b> you might <b>say no,</b> it should not be included among the items that may be bought with second-tithe money. Therefore, <b>the Torah wrote:</b> “On <b>strong drink.”</b><br>The necessity of each word much be proven in the opposite order as well. <b>And if the Torah had</b> only <b>written “on strong drink,” I might have said: What is</b> meant by <b>strong drink? Dried figs from</b> the town of <b>Ke’ila, which are</b> choice and juicy figs that can have an intoxicating effect. They are therefore considered <b>produce</b> and not merely mead. <b>But</b> as for buying <b>wine</b> together <b>with its jug,</b> you might <b>say no,</b> this may not be done with second-tithe money, and therefore it was necessary to state “on wine.”<br><b>And if the Torah had</b> also <b>written</b> “on wine,” indicating that one may buy even <b>wine</b> together <b>with its jug</b> with second-tithe money, I might have said that this is because the jug <b>is</b> needed for the wine’s <b>preservation. But</b> as for buying a <b>sheep</b> together <b>with its fleece,</b> you might <b>say no,</b> this may not be done with second-tithe money. Therefore, <b>the Torah stated</b> “on <b>sheep,”</b> to teach <b>that</b> a sheep may be bought with second-tithe money <b>even</b> together <b>with its fleece.</b><br>If so, <b>why do I</b> need the words <b>“on oxen”?</b> If one may purchase a sheep together with its fleece with second-tithe money, it should certainly be permitted to buy an ox together with its hide. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>if the Torah had not written “on oxen,” I might have said</b> that <b>a sheep</b> together <b>with its hide, yes,</b> it may be bought with second-tithe money, but together <b>with its fleece, no,</b> it may not be bought; therefore, <b>the Torah wrote “on oxen,” to include its hide,</b> and so “on <b>sheep” remains</b> available for interpretation <b>to include its fleece,</b> i.e., that a sheep may be bought even together with its fleece. Therefore, the words “on oxen” are necessary, for without them I would have understood “on sheep” differently.<br>This argument can, however, be refuted: Even <b>if the Torah had not written “on oxen,” I would not have said</b> that a <b>sheep</b> together <b>with its hide, yes,</b> it may be bought with second-tithe money, but together <b>with its fleece, no,</b> it may not. For <b>if</b> it were <b>so, the Torah should have written</b> “on <b>oxen,” in which case</b> the words “on <b>sheep” would remain</b> available for interpretation. “On sheep” can be explained in two ways, both in reference to its hide as well as in reference to its fleece. Had the Torah wanted to teach only that an animal may be bought together with its hide but not with its fleece, it would have written “on oxen” only, which would have left no room for error, as oxen do not have fleece.<br><b>And since the Torah writes</b> “on <b>sheep,”</b> teaching that a sheep may be bought with second-tithe money <b>even</b> together <b>with its fleece, why do I need</b> the words <b>“on oxen”?</b> These words are <b>now</b> entirely superfluous. If a <b>sheep may be bought</b> together <b>with its fleece, is it necessary</b> to state that an <b>ox</b> may be bought together <b>with its hide? This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> meant when he <b>said: Whoever interprets</b> the words <b>“on oxen” for me in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag, I will carry his clothes after him into the bathhouse.</b><br>The Gemara now returns to the tannaitic disagreement pertaining to buying fish brine with second-tithe money: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish, and Rabbi Eliezer, and these <i>tanna’im</i></b> whose views will be cited <b>below, disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish and Rabbi Eliezer expound</b> the verse based on the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions, and these <i>tanna’im</i> expound</b> it based on the principle of <b>generalizations and details,</b> which is a different approach to biblical exegesis.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish and Rabbi Eliezer expound</b> the verse based on the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> When the verse states: <b>“And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26), <b>it has amplified.</b> When it then states: <b>“On oxen, on sheep, on wine, and on strong drink,” it has restricted</b> its discussion to certain specific items. When it concludes with the phrase: <b>“On whatever your soul requests,” it has</b> once <b>again amplified.</b> According to this exegetical approach, we conclude that since <b>it amplified and restricted and</b> once again <b>amplified, it has amplified</b> the general category to include <b>everything. What has it amplified</b> the category to include? <b>It has amplified</b> the category to include <b>everything. And what has it restricted</b> from inclusion in the category? Only one thing: <b>According to Rabbi Eliezer, it restricted brine</b> from inclusion because brine is not at all similar to the items listed in the verse; <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish, it restricted water and salt.</b><br><b>And these</b> other <b><i>tanna’im</i> expound</b> the verse according to the principle of <b>generalizations and details, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase: <b>“And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as no particular type of food is specified. The phrase: <b>“On cattle, on sheep, on wine, and on strong drink”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> as specific types of food are mentioned. When the verse concludes: <b>“On whatever your soul requests,” it has generalized again,</b> as no specific type of food is mentioned. Since the verse is formulated as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as the produce of produce,</b> i.e., not only the produce itself but also things that come from it, such as the calf that comes from a cow or grapes from a seed, <b>and</b> they are also things <b>grown from the ground,</b> as all of these items grow from the ground or receive their main sustenance from it, <b>so</b> it includes <b>all</b> things that are <b>the produce of produce and are grown from the ground.</b><br><b>And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as the offspring of the offspring of the earth,</b> i.e., things that come from items that came from the ground, <b>so</b> it includes <b>all</b> things that are <b>the offspring of the offspring of the earth.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two <i>baraitot</i>? <b>Abaye said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>fish. According to the one who said</b> that we apply the law to that which is <b>the produce of produce and grown from the ground, fish are</b> regarded as having <b>grown from the ground.</b> However, <b>according to the one who said</b> we apply it to that which is <b>the offspring of the offspring of the earth, fish were created from water.</b> Therefore, they are not of the offspring of the earth, and consequently they are not included among the items that may be purchased with second-tithe money.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Did Abaye say</b> that <b>fish are</b> regarded as having been <b>grown from the ground? Didn’t Abaye say the following?</b><br><br></body></html>
