Daf 26a<br><br>and <b>removed</b> the reeds, as he maintained that they were unnecessary; he regarded the entire orchard as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence, owing to the banqueting pavilion. <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, went after him and collected</b> the reeds, so as to prevent Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana from restoring the partitions, as they were Rava’s students and wanted to enforce his ruling.<br><b>On the following day,</b> on Shabbat, <b>Ravina raised an objection to Rava’s</b> opinion from a <i>baraita</i> which states: In the case of <b>a new town, we measure</b> the Shabbat limit <b>from its settled</b> area, from where it is actually inhabited; <b>and</b> in the case of <b>an old</b> town, we measure the Shabbat limit <b>from its wall,</b> even if it is not inhabited up to its wall.<br><b>What is a new</b> town, <b>and what is an old</b> town? <b>A new</b> town is one <b>that was</b> first <b>surrounded</b> by a wall, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward settled,</b> meaning that the town’s residents arrived after the wall had already been erected; <b>an old</b> town is one <b>that was</b> first <b>settled, and</b> only <b>afterward surrounded</b> by a wall. Ravina raised his objection: <b>And this</b> orchard <b>should also be considered like</b> a town <b>that was</b> first <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and</b> only <b>afterward settled,</b> as it had not been enclosed from the outset for the purpose of residence. Even if a dwelling was later erected there, this should not turn it into a place that had been enclosed for the purpose of residence.<br>Seeing that an additional objection could be raised against his teacher’s position, <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Didn’t Rav Asi say</b> that <b>the</b> temporary <b>screens</b> erected by <b>architects</b> to serve as protection against the sun and the like <b>are not deemed</b> valid <b>partitions? Apparently, since it was erected</b> only <b>for privacy,</b> and not for the purpose of permanent dwelling, <b>it is not considered a</b> valid <b>partition. Here too,</b> then, with regard to the fence around the orchard, <b>since it was erected</b> only <b>for privacy, it should not be considered a</b> valid <b>partition.</b><br>And <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: Didn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>a partition made for resting</b> objects alongside it and thereby providing them with protection <b>is not considered a</b> valid <b>partition?</b><br>This is <b>as Rabba bar Avuh</b> did, when he <b>constructed an <i>eiruv</i></b> separately for each <b>row of houses in the whole</b> town <b>of Meḥoza, due to the ditches</b> from which <b>the cattle</b> would feed that separated the rows of houses from one another. <b>Shouldn’t</b> such <b>cattle ditches be considered like a partition made for resting</b> objects alongside it? Such a partition is invalid. All these proofs indicate that Rava was wrong to remove the reed fences erected by Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana, for those fences were indeed necessary.<br>With regard to the resolution of this incident, <b>the Exilarch recited</b> the following <b>verse about</b> these Rabbis: <b>“They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge”</b> (Jeremiah 4:22), as on Friday they ruined the arrangement that Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana had made to permit carrying from the house to the pavilion, and the next day all they could do was prove that they had acted improperly the day before and that it was prohibited to carry in the orchard.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elai said: I heard from Rabbi Eliezer</b> that one is permitted to carry in a garden or <i>karpef</i>, <b>even</b> if the garden <b>is</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> thirty times larger than a <i>beit se’a</i>. The Gemara notes that all agree that what the mishna taught was <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says:</b> One is permitted to carry <b>even if it</b> is the size of <b>forty <i>beit se’a</i>, like the court of a king.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Both</b> Rabbi Elai and Ḥananya <b>derived</b> their opinion <b>from the same verse, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle courtyard,</b> that the word of the Lord came to him, saying” (ii Kings 20:4). In the biblical text, <b>it is written: “The city [<i>ha’ir</i>],” and we read</b> it as: “The middle <b>courtyard [<i>ḥatzer</i>],”</b> as there is a difference in this verse between the written word and how it is spoken. <b>From here</b> it is derived that <b>royal courts were</b> as large <b>as intermediate-</b>sized <b>cities.</b> Consequently, there is no contradiction, as the central courtyard of the royal palace was itself like a small town.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Elai and Ḥananya <b>disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elai, <b>maintains: Intermediate-</b>sized <b>towns are</b> the size of a field that had an area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Ḥananya, <b>maintains: They are</b> the size of <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b><br>The Gemara asks about the Biblical narrative cited above: <b>What did Isaiah need</b> to do <b>there</b> in the middle court, i.e., why was he there? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This teaches that Hezekiah took ill, and Isaiah went and established a</b> Torah <b>academy at his door,</b> so that Torah scholars would sit and occupy themselves with Torah outside his room, the merit of which would help Hezekiah survive.<br><b>Based on this,</b> it is derived, <b>with regard to a Torah scholar who took ill, that one establishes an academy at</b> the <b>entrance</b> to <b>his</b> home. The Gemara comments: <b>This,</b> however, <b>is not a</b> proper <b>course</b> of action, as <b>perhaps they will come to provoke Satan against him.</b> Challenging Satan might worsen the health of a sick person rather than improve it.<br>The mishna cites another statement made by Rabbi Elai in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: <b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>: If <b>one of the residents of a courtyard forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents, and on Shabbat he ceded ownership of his share in the courtyard to the other residents, it <b>is prohibited</b> for him, the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, to bring in objects or take them out from <b>his house</b> to the courtyard; but it is permitted to the other residents to bring objects from their houses to that other person’s house via the courtyard, and vice versa.<br>The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: It <b>is prohibited</b> for the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i> to bring in objects or take them out from <b>his house</b> to the courtyard, <b>and for</b> the other residents who did make an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>to take out</b> objects from the house to the courtyard <b>or to bring</b> them into the house from the courtyard.<br><b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is <b>not difficult.</b><br><br>Daf 26b<br><br><b>This,</b> the mishna here, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, while that,</b> the other mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b><br>Rav Sheshet adds: <b>When you examine</b> the matter closely, you will find that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, one who renounces</b> his <b>authority over his</b> share in the <b>courtyard</b> to the other residents of the courtyard also <b>renounces</b> his <b>authority over his</b> own <b>house.</b> However, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, one who renounces</b> his <b>authority over his</b> share in the <b>courtyard</b> to the other residents <b>does not renounce</b> his <b>authority over his</b> own <b>house</b> to them.<br>The Gemara expresses surprise at this comment: But it is <b>obvious</b> that this is the point over which the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Raḥava said:</b> Both <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana and I explained:</b> Rav Sheshet’s explanation <b>was necessary only with regard to</b> the case of <b>five</b> people <b>who lived in the same courtyard, one of whom forgot to join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the others.<br><b>According to the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, when he renounces his authority, he need not renounce it to each and every one</b> of the residents, as we already know that Rabbi Eliezer holds that one who renounces authority does so in a generous manner, renouncing authority not only of his share in the courtyard, but also of his own house. Consequently, if he is required to renounce authority to many people, we assume that he does so even if this is not explicitly stated.<br>In contrast, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, when he renounces his authority,</b> it does not suffice that he renounces it in favor of one person; rather, <b>he must</b> explicitly <b>renounce it to each and every one,</b> as we cannot presume that he renounces authority in a generous manner.<br>The Gemara continues: <b>In accordance with which</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> the ruling <b>that was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>? If <b>five</b> people <b>lived in the same courtyard, and one of them forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents, <b>when he renounces his authority, he need not renounce his authority to each and every one</b> of the residents. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it? It is <b>in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as explained above.<br><b>Rav Kahana taught</b> the passage <b>this way,</b> as cited above, that it was Raḥava and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana who applied Rav Sheshet’s explanation to the case of the five people living in the same courtyard. <b>Rav Tavyomei,</b> on the other hand, <b>taught</b> it <b>as follows,</b> that it was Rav Sheshet himself who applied it to that case: <b>In accordance with which</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> the ruling <b>that was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>? If <b>five</b> people <b>lived in the same courtyard, and one of them forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents, <b>when he renounces his authority, he need not renounce his authority to each and every one</b> of the residents. This statement is <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion? <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: In accordance with whom? In accordance with Rabbi Eliezer.</b><br><b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> which presumes that one renounces his authority over his house as well, <b>if one</b> who forgot to join in an <i>eiruv</i> with the other residents of the courtyard explicitly <b>stated: I am not renouncing</b> authority of my house, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, if he</b> explicitly <b>stated: I am renouncing</b> authority of my house, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in such cases?<br>The Gemara clarifies: Is <b>Rabbi Eliezer’s reason because he maintains</b> in general that <b>one who renounces authority over his</b> share in a courtyard to the other residents presumably also <b>renounces</b> to them <b>authority over his</b> own <b>house, but</b> that since <b>this</b> person explicitly <b>stated: I am not renouncing</b> authority of my house, he therefore maintains his authority?<br><b>Or perhaps Rabbi Eliezer’s reason</b> is <b>because people do not</b> generally <b>live</b> in <b>a house without a courtyard,</b> and therefore anyone who renounces authority over his share in a courtyard automatically renounces authority over his own house regardless of what he says. Therefore, <b>when he says: I am not renouncing</b> authority over my house, it is <b>not in his power</b> to do so, <b>as even though he says: I</b> will continue <b>to live</b> in and retain authority over my house, <b>he has said nothing.</b><br><b>And</b> the question likewise arises <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. If one</b> explicitly <b>stated: I am renouncing</b> authority of my house as well, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is <b>the reason</b> for the opinion of <b>the Rabbis because they maintain</b> that <b>one who renounces authority over his</b> share in a <b>courtyard</b> to the other residents presumably <b>does not renounce authority over his</b> own <b>house</b> to them, <b>but</b> since <b>this</b> person explicitly <b>stated: I am renouncing</b> authority over my house, the other residents should be permitted to carry?<br><b>Or perhaps the reason</b> for the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> is <b>because one does not usually remove himself entirely from a house and courtyard, making himself like a guest among</b> his neighbors. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when he states: I am renouncing</b> authority over my house, it is <b>not in his power</b> to do so, and his statement is disregarded.<br>Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa in answer to his question: <b>Both according to the Rabbis and according to Rabbi Eliezer, once one has revealed his wishes, he has revealed</b> them, and everything follows his express wishes.<br>The mishna records yet another teaching handed down by Rabbi Elai: <b>And I also heard from</b> Rabbi Eliezer another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that one may fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover with <i>arkablin</i>,</b> a certain bitter herb. The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>arkablin</i>? Reish Lakish said:</b> It is <b><i>Atzvata ḥaruziyata</i>,</b> a type of fiber that wraps itself around a date palm.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may establish a joining</b> of houses in courtyards [<i>eiruv ḥatzerot</i>] in order to permit carrying on Shabbat in a courtyard shared by two or more houses, and one may establish a joining of Shabbat borders [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] in order to extend the distance one is permitted to walk on Shabbat; <b>and</b> similarly, <b>one may merge</b> courtyards in order to permit carrying in an alleyway shared by two or more courtyards. This may be done <b>with all</b> kinds of food <b>except for water and salt,</b> as they are not considered foods and therefore may not be used for these purposes.<br>The mishna continues with two similar principles: <b>All</b> types of food <b>may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> which must be taken to Jerusalem and used to purchase food (Deuteronomy 14:26), <b>except for water and salt.</b> Similarly, <b>one who vows that nourishment</b> is prohibited to him <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>water and salt,</b> as they are not considered sources of nourishment.<br>It was further stated with regard to the laws of joining courtyards that <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> <i>teḥumin</i> <b>for a nazirite with wine,</b> even though he is prohibited to drink it, because it is permitted to others. <b>And</b> similarly, one may establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> <b>for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>,</b> even though he may not eat it, because it is permitted to a priest. The food used for an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> must be fit for human consumption, but it is not essential that it be fit for the consumption of the one for whom it is being used. <b>Summakhos,</b> however, <b>says:</b> One may only establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> for an Israelite <b>with unconsecrated</b> food.<br>It was additionally stated that one may establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> <b>for a priest in a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> a field containing a grave that was plowed over. There is doubt as to the location of bone fragments in the entire area. A priest is prohibited to come into contact with a corpse, and therefore may not enter a <i>beit haperas</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> An <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> may be established for a priest <b>even between the graves</b> in a graveyard, an area which the priest may not enter by Torah law,<br><br></body></html>
