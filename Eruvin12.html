Daf 12a<br><br><b>at</b> the town of <b>Ovelin, and found him dwelling in an alleyway that had only one side post. He said to him: My son, set up another side post.</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: Am I required to close it up?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Let it be closed up; what does it matter?</b><br>We learned in that same <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about an alleyway</b> whose width <b>is less than four cubits,</b> as they both agree <b>that</b> this alleyway <b>does not require anything</b> to render it permitted for one to carry within it. <b>About what did they disagree? About</b> an alleyway that is <b>wider than four cubits, and up to ten</b> cubits; <b>as Beit Shammai say:</b> It is permitted to carry within it only if there is both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam, and Beit Hillel say:</b> It requires <b>either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam.</b><br>The Gemara explains the proof from this <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>In any case, it teaches:</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Perida said to Rabbi Eliezer: <b>Am I required to seal it? Granted, if you say</b> that Rabbi Eliezer requires two <b>side posts and a</b> cross <b>beam, for that</b> reason the disciple <b>said: Am I required to seal it? However, if you say</b> that he requires <b>side posts without a</b> cross <b>beam, what</b> is the meaning of <b>to seal it?</b> The entrance to the alleyway remains open from above.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: No absolute proof can be cited from here, as perhaps <b>this is what he is saying: Am I required to seal it with side posts?</b><br><b>The Master said</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said</b> that <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel do not disagree about an alleyway</b> whose width <b>is less than four cubits,</b> as they both agree <b>that it does not require anything</b> to render it permitted to carry within it. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>A certain disciple said before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about an alleyway</b> whose width <b>is less than four cubits,</b> as they both agree <b>that</b> carrying in an alleyway of that sort <b>is permitted by either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam.</b> How could Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel have said that according to Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel even that minimal action is unnecessary?<br><b>Rav Ashi said: This is</b> what Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>is saying. It neither requires</b> both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, nor</b> does it require two <b>side posts, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer; rather,</b> it requires <b>either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam, in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Beit Hillel</b> with regard to a large alleyway. When it said that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel does not require anything, it meant anything more than that required by Beit Hillel.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> narrow must an alleyway be so that it would not require even a side post, according to all opinions? <b>Rav Aḥlei said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yeḥiel</b> who said: <b>Up to</b> a width of <b>four</b> handbreadths, the alleyway requires nothing in order to render it permitted for one to carry within it.<br><b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to the</b> upright <b>boards of a courtyard.</b> That is to say, the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer only about the number of side posts needed to permit carrying within an alleyway. However, they agree that if a courtyard was breached into the public domain, it can be considered closed only if upright boards of wall, similar to side posts, remain on both sides of the breach. <b>But Rav Naḥman said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer with regard to the</b> upright <b>boards of</b> wall that are required in <b>a courtyard.</b><br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Who</b> are the Rabbis to whom Rav referred when he stated that they <b>concede</b> to Rabbi Eliezer? He was referring to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Furthermore, as Rav Naḥman said that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, one can learn <b>by inference that</b> the Sages <b>dispute</b> this issue as well. <b>Who</b> are the ones who <b>disagree with</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? It is <b>the Rabbis, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a courtyard</b> that was breached into the public domain, with the width of the breach not exceeding ten cubits, it <b>is permitted</b> to carry if <b>one</b> upright <b>board</b> remains on one side of the breach. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is permitted only if there remain <b>two</b> upright <b>boards,</b> one on each side of the breach.<br><b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A courtyard</b> that was breached <b>requires two</b> upright <b>boards</b> of wall on either side of the breach, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>say that? But weren’t you the one who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The</b> upright <b>boards in a courtyard must be four</b> handbreadths wide? This indicates that only one board is necessary. <b>And if you say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan requires one upright <b>four</b> handbreadths board <b>from here,</b> one side of the breach, <b>and</b> one upright <b>four</b> handbreadths board <b>from there,</b> the other side of the breach, this is difficult.<br><b>But didn’t Rav Adda bar Avimi teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Ḥanina, and some say</b> it was <b>before Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> governing a small courtyard that was breached along its entire length into a large courtyard. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the residents of the large courtyard may use their courtyard even if the <b>small</b> courtyard has a width of <b>ten</b> cubits, <b>and the large</b> one has a width of <b>eleven</b> cubits. In this case, the difference between the length of the smaller courtyard and that of the larger courtyard is only one cubit, i.e., six handbreadths. Therefore, there cannot be upright boards of four handbreadths on each side, as together they would amount to more than a cubit.<br>The Gemara resolves this difficulty: <b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended from</b> his <b>sea</b> travels, <b>he explained</b> the contradiction between the statements of Rav Yoḥanan in the following manner: If there is a upright board <b>in</b> only <b>one direction,</b> it must be <b>four</b> handbreadths, however, if there are upright boards <b>from two directions,</b> it suffices if there is <b>any amount here,</b> on one side, <b>and any amount there,</b> on the other side.<br><b>And that which Adda bar Avimi taught</b> with regard to the difference in size between the two courtyards is not universally accepted, as according to Rabbi Zeira it is sufficient if one courtyard is four handbreadths larger than the other. Rather, <b>it is</b> in accordance with the view of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who requires two upright boards of wall in a breached courtyard. And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who says that a side post must be at least three handbreadths wide. Consequently, the two upright boards together must be at least six handbreadths, which is why the minimum difference between the smaller and the larger courtyards is a cubit.<br><b>Rav Yosef said that Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said:</b> A breached <b>courtyard is permitted</b> if <b>one</b> upright <b>board</b> of wall remains on one side of the breach. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Did Shmuel</b> really <b>say this? But didn’t Shmuel say to Rav Ḥananya bar Sheila: You must not perform an action,</b> i.e., issue a ruling to permit carrying in a breached courtyard, <b>unless</b> there remains standing <b>either the majority of the wall or two</b> upright <b>boards</b> on either side of the breach.<br>Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>I do not know</b> how to resolve this contradiction. All I know is that <b>there was an incident in a shepherds’ village</b> with regard to <b>a narrow inlet of the sea that penetrated a courtyard,</b> breaching one of its walls in its entirety, <b>and</b> the matter <b>came before Rav Yehuda, and he required only one</b> upright <b>board</b> of wall to remain in order to permit it.<br>Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>You speak of a narrow inlet of the sea,</b> but an inlet is different and nothing can be derived from that case, for we know that <b>this is a leniency in which the Sages lessened</b> the requirements <b>in</b> cases involving <b>water.</b> In these cases, the Sages did not require properly constructed partitions, but were satisfied with inferior ones.<br>The Gemara supports the assertion that the Sages were more lax with regard to water from the following <b>dilemma</b> that <b>Rabbi Tavla raised before Rav: Does a suspended partition permit</b> carrying <b>in a ruin?</b> Do we say that the remnants of the walls that are suspended in the air are considered as if they descend to the ground, closing off the area so that it is regarded as a private domain? Rav <b>said to him: A suspended partition</b> of this kind <b>permits</b> carrying <b>only</b> in the case of <b>water; this is a leniency in which the Sages lessened</b> the requirements <b>in</b> cases involving <b>water.</b><br>The Gemara continues: <b>In any case, it is difficult.</b> The contradiction between the conflicting statements of Shmuel remains unresolved.<br>The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>When Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from the house of their teacher, they explained</b> the contradiction in the following manner: If there is an upright board <b>from</b> only <b>one direction,</b> it must be <b>of four</b> handbreadths; but if there are upright boards <b>from two directions,</b> i.e., both sides of the breach, it suffices if there is <b>a bit here,</b> on one side, <b>and bit here,</b> on the other side.<br><b>Rav Pappa said: If</b> this issue <b>is difficult for me</b> to understand, <b>this is my difficulty: For Shmuel said to Rav Ḥananya bar Sheila: You must not perform an action,</b> i.e., issue a ruling to permit carrying in a breached courtyard, <b>unless</b> there remains standing <b>either most of the wall or two</b> upright <b>boards</b> on either side of the breach.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need most of the wall?</b> An upright <b>board of four</b> handbreadths <b>should suffice.</b> The Gemara further explains the difficulty: <b>And if you say, what is</b> the meaning of <b>most of the wall</b> mentioned here? It is referring to the special case where the <b>wall</b> is <b>seven</b> handbreadths wide, so that <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>constitutes most of the wall,</b> this too is difficult. Even if the wall is seven handbreadths wide, <b>why do I</b> require an upright board of <b>four</b> handbreadths to seal? <b>Three</b> handbreadths <b>and any amount should suffice, as Rav Aḥlei, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yeḥiel who said:</b> A narrow alleyway <b>up to four</b> handbreadths wide requires nothing at all. Here too, after sealing up slightly more than three handbreadths, the remaining gap that remains is less than four handbreadths, so nothing further should be required.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>here,</b> the statement of Shmuel is referring <b>to a courtyard,</b> where even a breach of less than four handbreadths requires action. <b>There,</b> the statement of Rav Aḥlei, is referring <b>to an alleyway. And if you wish, say</b> that the statement of <b>Rav Aḥlei is itself</b> subject to a dispute between the <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b><br><b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a narrow inlet of the sea that enters into a courtyard,</b> partially breaching one of its walls, <b>one may not fill</b> water <b>from it on Shabbat.</b> The inlet is a <i>karmelit</i>, from which it is prohibited to carry into a private domain, e.g. a courtyard. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>unless there is a partition ten handbreadths high</b> at one side of the wall’s breach, which would incorporate the inlet as part of the courtyard. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? Where the breach</b> through which the water enters <b>is more than ten</b> cubits wide; <b>but</b> if it is only <b>ten</b> cubits wide, <b>nothing is required.”</b><br>The Gemara asks: The <i>baraita</i> indicates that <b>one may not fill</b> water from the inlet because that would involve carrying from a <i>karmelit</i> into a private domain, <b>but</b> in the courtyard itself <b>one may</b> indeed <b>carry. But isn’t the courtyard breached along its entirety,</b> i.e., more than ten cubits, <b>into a place that is prohibited to it?</b> Since it is prohibited to carry to or from the inlet, it should also be prohibited to carry within the courtyard itself.<br><br>Daf 12b<br><br>The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? It is a case <b>where</b> the wall has not been fully breached, but rather <b>remnants of the wall</b> remain on each side (Rabbeinu Ḥananel; Rif).<br><b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If several courtyards open onto a common alleyway, the residents of the houses in the courtyards are prohibited to carry in the alleyway, unless the alleyway is rendered fit for one to carry within it by placing a side post or a cross beam at its entrance, and by the inhabitants of each courtyard placing food in a common area for the duration of Shabbat, symbolically converting the entire alleyway into a single household. It is prohibited to carry in <b>an alleyway</b> that the residents <b>did not merge.</b> Nevertheless, if the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> means of <b>a side post</b> placed at its entrance, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable;</b> the side post functions as a partition, and the alleyway is deemed a full-fledged private domain. If, however, the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> means of a cross <b>beam, one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is exempt;</b> the cross beam functions only as a conspicuous marker. It is not considered a partition that renders the alleyway a private domain.<br><b>Rav Sheshet strongly objects to this</b> due to the following: <b>The reason</b> that one is exempt in the latter case is due to the fact the residents of the alleyway <b>did not merge.</b> By inference, <b>if they did</b> in fact <b>merge, one would be liable even if</b> the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> way of a cross <b>beam.</b> This, however, is difficult. One can ask: <b>Does this loaf,</b> through which the residents joined together to form a single household, <b>render</b> the alleyway <b>a private domain or a public domain?</b><br><b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Courtyards</b> shared <b>by many and alleyways that are not open</b> on two opposite sides, <b>whether</b> the residents <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> or did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, one who throws</b> an object <b>into them</b> from the public domain <b>is liable.</b> This seems to contrary to Rav Yehuda’s statement.<br><b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated as follows. Rav Yehuda said:</b> In the case of <b>an alleyway that is not fit for merging,</b> i.e., an alleyway that is open on two opposite sides, if the alleyway <b>was rendered fit</b> for one to carry within it <b>by</b> means of <b>a side post, one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable.</b> In that case, the side post is considered a third partition, and since the alleyway is closed on three sides it is deemed a private domain. If, however, the alleyway <b>was rendered fit</b> for one to carry within in <b>by</b> means of a cross <b>beam, one who throws</b> an object <b>into it is exempt.</b><br><b>Apparently,</b> Rav Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>a side post</b> functions <b>as a partition, whereas a</b> cross <b>beam</b> functions <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> but is not considered a partition. <b>And, so too, Rabba said: A side post</b> functions <b>as a partition, whereas</b> a cross <b>beam</b> functions <b>as a conspicuous marker. But Rava said: Both this,</b> the side post, <b>and that,</b> the cross beam, function <b>as a conspicuous marker.</b><br><b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Abba raised an objection to Rava</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who throws</b> an object from the public domain <b>into an alleyway, if</b> the alleyway <b>has a side post, he is liable; if it does not have a side post he is exempt.</b> This shows that a side post is considered a proper partition.<br>Rava replied: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the alleyway is closed on one side such that <b>it requires only a side post</b> in order to permit carrying within in, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable</b> because the alleyway already has three partitions and is therefore a proper private domain according to Torah law. However, if the alleyway requires <b>a side post and something else</b> in order to permit carrying within it, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is exempt</b> because the alleyway has only two partitions and is therefore not considered a private domain.<br><b>He raised an</b> additional <b>objection</b> to Rava from the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is as follows with regard to <b>one who has two houses</b> opposite each other <b>on two sides of the public domain,</b> if he chooses, <b>he may</b> create a private domain for himself in the area of the public domain. He may <b>place a</b> ten-handbreadth high <b>side post from here,</b> perpendicular to the public domain. This creates a symbolic wall which, in the <i>halakhot</i> of alleyways, has the legal status of a wall. <b>And,</b> he may place <b>an</b> additional <b>post from here,</b> on the other side, and that has the same legal status as if he closed the public domain on all of its sides. <b>Or,</b> he can implement a different solution appropriate for alleyways by placing <b>a beam</b> extending <b>from here,</b> from one end of one house, to the end of the house opposite it. This creates a symbolic partition across the width of the street. <b>And,</b> he may place <b>a beam</b> extending <b>from here,</b> from the other side of the house. According to Rabbi Yehuda, in that way, one is permitted to <b>carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in</b> the area <b>between</b> the symbolic partitions, as he would in a private domain.<br>The Rabbis <b>said to him: One may not place an <i>eiruv</i> in the public domain in that</b> way. One who seeks to transform a public domain into a private domain must place actual partitions. Apparently, according to Rabbi Yehuda, the side posts function as partitions in the public domain, creating a private domain between the two houses. It follows from this that a side post is in fact deemed a proper partition, contrary to Rava’s statement.<br>The Gemara answers: This is not the reason behind Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. Rather, <b>there Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>by Torah law two partitions</b> suffice to constitute a private domain, and he requires side posts only as a conspicuous marker. Therefore, Rava’s position cannot be disproved from this source either.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> Unlike other alleyways, carrying within <b>an alleyway whose length is equal to its width is not permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post of minimal</b> width. Like a courtyard, carrying within it is permitted only by means of an upright board four handbreadths wide. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said in the name of Rav:</b> Carrying within <b>an alleyway whose length is equal to its width is not permitted by</b> a cross <b>beam</b> with the width <b>of a handbreadth.</b><br><b>Rabbi Zeira said: How precise are the traditions of the Elders.</b> He explains: <b>Since the length</b> of the alleyway <b>is equal to its width, it is</b> regarded like <b>a courtyard, and</b> carrying within <b>a courtyard is not permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or</b> a cross <b>beam, but</b> only <b>by</b> means of <b>an</b> upright <b>board of four</b> handbreadths.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Nonetheless, <b>if</b> this issue <b>is difficult for me</b> to understand, <b>this is my difficulty: Let this side post be</b> considered <b>like</b> an upright <b>board of minimal</b> width <b>and permit</b> carrying within the alleyway, just as an upright board permits carrying in a breached courtyard.<br>The Gemara explains that this is incorrect, as <b>that which Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said escaped</b> Rabbi Zeira’s <b>attention: The</b> upright <b>boards of a courtyard must be four</b> handbreadths wide, whereas a side post may be of minimal size.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said: We have a tradition</b> that states: <b>What is the</b> type of <b>alleyway</b> in <b>which</b> carrying <b>is permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or</b> a cross <b>beam? Any</b> alleyway <b>whose length is greater than its width and has houses and courtyards opening into it. And what is the</b> type of <b>courtyard</b> in <b>which</b> carrying <b>is not permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or</b> a cross <b>beam, but by</b> an upright <b>board of four</b> handbreadths? <b>Any</b> courtyard <b>that is square.</b><br>The Gemara wonders: If it is <b>square,</b> then <b>yes,</b> is it considered a courtyard? If it is <b>round, no,</b> is it not considered a courtyard? The Gemara makes a correction: <b>This is</b> what <b>it is saying: If its length is greater than its width, it is</b> considered <b>an alleyway, and</b> for <b>an alleyway a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam suffices; but if</b> its length is <b>not</b> greater than its width, i.e., it is square, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a courtyard.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> by <b>how much</b> must its length exceed its width so that it can be considered an alleyway? <b>Shmuel thought</b> at first <b>to say:</b> It is not considered an alleyway <b>unless</b> its length <b>is double its width,</b> until <b>Rav said to him: My uncle</b> [<b><i>ḥavivi</i></b>], Rav Ḥiyya, <b>said this: Even</b> if its length is greater than its width by only <b>a minimal amount,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of an alleyway apply to it.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>A certain disciple said</b> before Rabbi Akiva <b>in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, etc.</b><br><br></body></html>
