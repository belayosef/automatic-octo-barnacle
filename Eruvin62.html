Daf 62a<br><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rav Ḥinana bar Avin were sitting, and Abaye was sitting beside them, and they sat and said: Granted,</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the author of the unattributed mishna, is clear, as <b>he holds</b> that <b>the residence of a gentile is considered a</b> significant <b>residence.</b> In other words, the gentile living in the courtyard is considered a resident who has a share in the courtyard. Since he cannot join in an <i>eiruv</i> with the Jew, he renders it prohibited for the Jew to carry from his house to the courtyard or from the courtyard to his house. Consequently, the case of <b>one</b> Jew living in the courtyard is <b>no different</b> from the case of <b>two</b> Jews living there. In both cases, the gentile renders it prohibited for carrying.<br><b>But Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, what does he hold? If</b> you say <b>he holds</b> that <b>the residence of a gentile is considered a</b> significant <b>residence, he should prohibit</b> carrying <b>even</b> when there is only <b>one</b> Jew living in the courtyard. <b>And if it is not considered a</b> significant <b>residence, he should not prohibit</b> carrying <b>even</b> when there are <b>two</b> Jews living there.<br><b>Abaye said to them:</b> Your basic premise is based on a faulty assumption. <b>Does Rabbi Meir</b> actually <b>hold</b> that <b>the residence of a gentile is considered a</b> significant <b>residence? Wasn’t it taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>The courtyard of a gentile is like the pen of an animal,</b> i.e., just as an animal pen does not render it prohibited to carry in a courtyard, so too, the gentile’s residence in itself does not impose restrictions on a Jew.<br><b>Rather,</b> this explanation must be rejected, and the dispute in the mishna should be understood differently: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that <b>the residence of gentile is not considered a</b> significant <b>residence, and here they disagree about a decree</b> that was issued <b>lest</b> the Jew <b>learn from</b> the gentile’s <b>ways.</b> The disagreement is with regard to whether this decree is applicable only when there are two Jews living in the courtyard, or even when there is only one Jew living there.<br>The disagreement should be understood as follows: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>since a gentile is suspected of bloodshed,</b> it is unusual for a single Jew to share a courtyard with a gentile. However, it is not unusual for two or more Jews to do so, as they will protect each other. Therefore, in the case of <b>two</b> Jews, <b>who commonly live</b> together with a gentile in the same courtyard, the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> to the effect that the gentile renders it prohibited for them to carry. This would cause great inconvenience to Jews living with gentiles and would thereby motivate the Jews to distance themselves from gentiles. In this manner, the Sages sought to prevent the Jews from learning from the gentiles’ ways. However, in the case of <b>one</b> Jew, for whom <b>it is not common</b> to live together with a gentile in the same courtyard, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> that the gentile renders it prohibited for him to carry, as the Sages do not issue decrees for uncommon situations.<br>On the other hand, <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>sometimes it happens that</b> a single Jew <b>lives</b> together with a gentile in the same courtyard, and hence it is appropriate to issue the decree in such a case as well. <b>Therefore, the Sages said: An <i>eiruv</i> is not effective in a place</b> where <b>a gentile</b> is living, <b>nor is the renunciation of rights</b> to a courtyard in favor of the other residents <b>effective in a place</b> where <b>a gentile</b> is living. Therefore, carrying is prohibited in a courtyard in which a gentile resides, <b>unless</b> the gentile <b>rents</b> out his property to one of the Jews for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i> regardless of the number of Jews living there. <b>And</b> as <b>a gentile</b> would <b>not</b> be willing <b>to rent</b> out his property for this purpose, the living conditions will become too strained, prompting the Jew to move.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the reason</b> that a gentile will not rent out his property for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>because</b> the gentile <b>thinks</b> that <b>perhaps they will</b> later <b>come to take possession of his property</b> based on this rental, <b>this works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require a full-fledged rental,</b> i.e., that rental for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i> must be proper and valid according to all the <i>halakhot</i> of renting.<br><b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>a flawed,</b> symbolic <b>rental,</b> i.e., all that is needed is a token gesture that has the appearance of renting, <b>what is there to say?</b> The gentile would understand that it is not a real rental, and therefore he would not be wary of renting out his residence. <b>As it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed this issue as follows: <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that we require a <b>full-fledged rental, and Rav Sheshet said: A flawed,</b> symbolic <b>rental</b> is sufficient.<br>Having mentioned this dispute, the Gemara now clarifies its particulars: <b>What is</b> a <b>flawed</b> rental, and <b>what is</b> a <b>full-fledged</b> one? <b>If you say</b> that a <b>full-fledged</b> rental refers to a case where one gives another person <b>a <i>peruta</i></b> as rent, whereas in a <b>flawed</b> rental he provides him with <b>less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>,</b> this poses a difficulty. <b>Is there anyone who said</b> that renting <b>from a gentile for less than the value of a <i>peruta</i></b> is <b>not</b> valid? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Giyorei, send in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: You should know that one</b> may <b>rent from a gentile even for less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>?</b><br><b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A Noahide,</b> i.e., a gentile who stole <b>is executed</b> for his crime, according to the laws applying to Noahides, even if he stole <b>less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>.</b> A Noahide is particular about his property and unwilling to waive his rights to it, even if it is of minimal value; therefore, the prohibition against stealing applies to items of any value whatsoever. <b>And</b> in the case of Noahides, the stolen item <b>is not returnable,</b> as the possibility of rectification by returning a stolen object was granted only to Jews. The principle that less than the value of a <i>peruta</i> is not considered money applies to Jews alone. With regard to gentiles, it has monetary value, and therefore one may rent from a gentile with this amount.<br><b>Rather,</b> the distinction between a full-fledged rental and a flawed rental should be explained as follows: <b>A full-fledged</b> rental refers <b>to</b> one that is confirmed <b>by legal documents [<i>moharkei</i>]</b> and guaranteed by <b>officials [<i>aburganei</i>];</b> and <b>a flawed</b> rental means one that is <b>not</b> confirmed <b>by legal documents and</b> guaranteed by <b>officials,</b> an agreement that is unenforceable in court. Based on this explanation, the Gemara reiterates what was stated earlier with regard to the gentile’s concern about renting: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require a full-fledged rental,</b> as it is clear why the gentile would refuse to rent out his property.<br><b>But according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>a flawed rental, what is there to say</b> in this regard? Why shouldn’t the gentile want to rent out his residence? The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, the gentile is concerned</b> about <b>witchcraft,</b> i.e., that the procedure is used to cast a spell on him, <b>and</b> therefore he <b>does not rent out</b> his residence.<br>The Gemara examines the ruling in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited in the previous discussion. Returning to <b>the matter itself: The courtyard of a gentile is like the pen of an animal, and it is permitted to carry in and carry out from the courtyard to the houses and from the houses to the courtyard,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>eiruvin</i> do not apply to the residences of gentiles.<br><b>But if there is one Jew</b> living <b>there</b> in the same courtyard as the gentile, the gentile <b>renders it prohibited</b> for the Jew to carry from his house to the courtyard or vice versa. The Jew may carry there only if he rents the gentile’s property for the duration of Shabbat. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b><br><b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Actually,</b> the gentile <b>does not render it prohibited</b> for the Jew to carry <b>unless there are two Jews</b> living in the same courtyard who themselves would <b>prohibit one another</b> from carrying if there were no <i>eiruv</i>, and the presence of the gentile renders the <i>eiruv</i> ineffective.<br><br>Daf 62b<br><br>The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>The courtyard of a gentile is like the pen of an animal,</b> which implies that the residence of a gentile is not considered a significant residence. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> otherwise in the mishna: <b>One who resides with a gentile in</b> the same <b>courtyard this</b> person <b>prohibits him</b> from carrying? This implies that a gentile’s residence is in fact of significance.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the gentile <b>is present,</b> and therefore carrying is prohibited, whereas <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> refers to a situation <b>where he is not present,</b> and therefore carrying is permitted.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>What does</b> Rabbi Meir <b>hold? If he holds</b> that <b>a residence without</b> its <b>owners is</b> still <b>considered a residence,</b> and it is prohibited to carry in the courtyard even when the owner is away, then <b>even a gentile</b> in absentia <b>should likewise render it prohibited</b> for carrying. <b>And if he holds</b> that <b>a residence without</b> its <b>owners is not considered a residence,</b> then <b>even a Jew</b> who is away <b>should also not render it prohibited</b> for carrying.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he holds</b> that <b>a residence without</b> its <b>owners is not considered a residence, but</b> nevertheless, he draws a distinction between a Jew and a gentile. In the case of <b>a Jew, who renders it prohibited</b> to carry for those who dwell in the same courtyard <b>when</b> he is <b>present</b> in his residence, <b>the Sages decreed with regard to him</b> that even <b>when he is not present,</b> his residence renders it prohibited for them to carry as though he were present.<br>However, with regard to <b>a gentile,</b> who even <b>when he is present</b> does not fundamentally render it prohibited to carry, but only due to <b>a rabbinic decree</b> that was issued <b>lest</b> the Jew <b>learn from</b> the gentile’s <b>ways,</b> no further decree was necessary. Thus, <b>when he is present,</b> the gentile <b>renders it prohibited to</b> carry; but <b>when he is not present, he does not render it prohibited to</b> carry.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And when</b> the gentile <b>is not present, does he</b> really <b>not render it prohibited</b> for carrying? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> elsewhere in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who left his house</b> without establishing an <i>eiruv</i> <b>and went to spend Shabbat in a different town, whether</b> he was <b>a gentile or a Jew, he renders it prohibited</b> for the other residents of his courtyard to carry objects from their houses to the courtyard and vice versa. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Meir, a gentile renders it prohibited to carry in the courtyard even if he is not present.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the person who left his house without establishing an <i>eiruv</i> intends to <b>return on that</b> same <b>day,</b> on Shabbat. Since upon his return he will render it prohibited for others to carry in the courtyard, the decree is applied even before he returns home. However, if he left his house intending to return after the conclusion of Shabbat, he does not render it prohibited to carry, in absentia.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> in this dispute <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And Rav Huna said:</b> This is not an established <i>halakha</i> to be issued publicly; rather, <b>the custom is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> i.e., a Sage would rule according to his opinion for those who come to ask. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The people are accustomed</b> to conduct themselves <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> Accordingly, a Sage would not issue such a ruling even to those who inquire, but if someone acts leniently in accordance with his opinion, he would not object.<br><b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef,</b> his teacher: <b>We maintain</b> that <b>the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> measures <b>a kav, but is clean,</b> meaning that it is small in quantity but clear and complete, and that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion in all instances. Moreover, with regard to our issue, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> and therefore there is no doubt about the matter.<br>However, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether a disciple <b>may issue a ruling</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>in his teacher’s place</b> of jurisdiction, i.e., in a place where he is the recognized authority? Although it is usually prohibited to do so, perhaps such an evident and well-known principle such as this does not fall into the category of rulings that a disciple may not issue in his teacher’s territory.<br>Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Even</b> when <b>Rav Ḥisda was asked</b> about the permissibility of cooking <b>an egg in <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> a dairy dish, <b>throughout the years of Rav Huna’s</b> life, <b>he refused to issue a ruling.</b> Rav Ḥisda was a disciple of Rav Huna, and a disciple may not issue a ruling in his teacher’s place of jurisdiction about even the simplest of matters.<br><b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Abba said to Abaye:</b> With regard to matters <b>such as</b> those detailed in <b><i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>, which</b> is <b>written and laid</b> on the shelf for all to access and offers a list of the days on which fasting is prohibited, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning whether or not a disciple <b>may rule</b> about these matters <b>in his teacher’s place</b> of jurisdiction? Abaye <b>said to him: Rav Yosef said as follows: Even</b> when <b>Rav Ḥisda was asked about</b> the permissibility of cooking <b>an egg in <i>kutaḥ</i> throughout the years of Rav Huna’s</b> life, <b>he refused to issue a ruling.</b><br>The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> nonetheless <b>issued</b> halakhic <b>rulings in</b> the town of <b>Kafri during the years of Rav Huna’s</b> life, as he was not actually in his teacher’s place.<br><br></body></html>
