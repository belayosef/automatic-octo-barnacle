Daf 54a<br><br><b>She kicked him</b> and <b>said to him: Isn’t it written as follows: “Ordered in all things and secure”</b> (ii Samuel 23:5), which indicates that <b>if</b> the Torah <b>is ordered in your 248 limbs,</b> i.e., if you exert your entire body in studying it, <b>it will be secure, and if not, it will not be secure.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>it was</b> similarly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer had a student who would study quietly,</b> and <b>after three years he forgot his studies.</b><br>Incidental to the story cited above involving a student of Rabbi Eliezer, the Gemara cites the following episode: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer had a student who was liable for</b> the punishment of death by <b>burning,</b> for his sins <b>against God,</b> but the Rabbis <b>said: Let him</b> alone and do not punish him as he deserves, because <b>he served a great person.</b><br>The Gemara cites instructions issued by Shmuel that are similar to those of Berurya. <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Keen scholar [<i>shinnana</i>], open your mouth and read</b> from the Torah, <b>open your mouth and study</b> the Talmud, <b>in order that</b> your studies <b>should endure in you and</b> that <b>you should live a long life, as it is stated: “For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh”</b> (Proverbs 4:22). <b>Do not read: “To those who find them [<i>lemotzeihem</i>],” but</b> rather <b>“to those who express them [<i>lemotzi’eihem</i>],” with</b> their <b>mouth.</b><br>The Gemara cites additional instructions issued by Shmuel: <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda,</b> his beloved student: <b>Keen scholar, grab and eat, grab and drink, as the world from which we are departing is like a wedding feast,</b> whose joy is only temporary, and one who does not take pleasure in it now will not be able to do so in the future.<br>Similarly, <b>Rav said to Rav Hamnuna: My son, if you have</b> money, <b>do well for yourself.</b> There is no point waiting, <b>as there is no pleasure in the netherworld, and death does not tarry. And if you say: I will</b> save up in order to <b>leave for my children, who told you the law of the netherworld,</b> i.e., how do you know which of you will die first (<i>Arukh</i>)? <b>People are similar to grass of the field,</b> in that <b>these blossom,</b> i.e., grow, and their actions are blessed, <b>and these wither</b> and die.<br>Having expounded the verse “For they are life to those who find them” as referring to the Torah, the Gemara cites another teaching related to this verse that praises the Torah. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who is walking along the way without a companion</b> and is afraid <b>should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the words of Torah: <b>“For they shall be a graceful wreath [<i>livyat ḥen</i>]</b> for your head, and chains about your neck” (Proverbs 1:9). The word <i>livyat</i> is understood here as a reference to <i>levaya</i>, accompaniment, so that the verse is interpreted to mean that Torah is a graceful accompaniment to one who is traveling.<br><b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his head should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “For they shall be a graceful wreath for your head.” One who feels</b> pain <b>in his throat should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And chains about your neck.” One who feels</b> pain <b>in his intestines should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8). <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his bones should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And marrow to your bones”</b> (Proverbs 3:8). <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his entire body should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And health to all their flesh”</b> (Proverbs 4:22).<br><b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, said: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that when <b>a person gives a drug to his fellow, it is good for this</b> part of his body <b>and it is harmful to that</b> other part of his body. <b>But</b> the attribute of <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not so; He gave the Torah to the Jewish people,</b> and <b>it is a drug of life for one’s entire body, as it is stated: “And health to all their flesh.”</b><br>The Gemara continues with praise for Torah study and knowledge. <b>Rav Ami said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you; let them be firmly attached together to your lips”</b> (Proverbs 22:18)? <b>When are words of Torah pleasant? When you keep them within you</b> and know them. <b>And when will you keep them within you? When they will be attached together to your lips,</b> i.e., when you articulate them audibly and expound them.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “A man has joy in the answer of his mouth; and a word in due season, how good it is”</b> (Proverbs 15:23). <b>When does a man have joy? When an answer</b> related to Torah study <b>is in his mouth. Another version: When does a man have joy in the answer of his mouth? When</b> he experiences the fulfillment of: <b>A word in due season, how good it is,</b> i.e., when he knows when and how to address each issue.<br><b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “But the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:14). <b>When</b> is it <b>very near to you? When it is in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it,</b> i.e., when you articulate your Torah study.<br><b>Rava said</b> that this idea is actually derived <b>from here: “You have given him his heart’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah”</b> (Psalms 21:3). <b>When have You given him his heart’s desire? When You have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah,</b> i.e., when he converses in words of Torah.<br><b>Rava raised an</b> internal <b>contradiction</b> in that very verse: In the beginning of the verse <b>it is written: “You have given him his heart’s desire,”</b> implying that it is enough for one to request in his heart, whereas in the end of the verse <b>it is written: “And You have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah,”</b> indicating that one must express his prayers verbally. Rava himself resolved the contradiction: If one <b>is fortunate, “You have given him his heart’s desire,”</b> even if he does not give verbal expression to his wants. But if he <b>is not fortunate,</b> at least <b>“You have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah.”</b><br>With regard to the end of this verse, a Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Wherever it states <i>netzaḥ</i></b>, <b>Selah,</b> or <b><i>va’ed</i></b>, the matter <b>will never cease. <i>Netzaḥ</i>, as it is written: “For I will not contend forever; neither will I be eternally [<i>lanetzaḥ</i>] angry”</b> (Isaiah 57:16), which demonstrates that <i>netzaḥ</i> bears a similar meaning to forever.<br><b>Selah, as it is written: “As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of Hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it forever, Selah”</b> (Psalms 48:9), which demonstrates that Selah means forever. <b><i>Va’ed</i>, as it is written: “The Lord shall reign forever and ever [<i>va’ed</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:18).<br>In light of the previous discussion, the Gemara cites several expositions of verses proposed by Rabbi Eliezer, while first providing them with a <b>mnemonic: Chains, cheeks, tablets, engraved. Rabbi Eliezer said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And chains about your neck”</b> (Proverbs 1:9)? <b>If a person makes himself like a chain that hangs loosely on the neck,</b> i.e., if a scholar is not pushy and disruptive to others, <b>and</b> he is also <b>seen but not seen,</b> i.e., just as a chain is covered by clothes and hair, so too, the scholar does not let himself be seen, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will endure. But if not,</b> if he acts in a rude and arrogant manner, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure.</b><br><b>And Rabbi Eliezer</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “His cheeks are like a bed of spices”</b> (Song of Songs 5:13)? <b>If a person makes himself</b> humble <b>like this</b> garden <b>bed upon which everyone treads, and like this spice with which everyone perfumes himself,</b> i.e., which benefits not only the one who wears it, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will endure. But if not, his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure.</b><br><b>And Rabbi Eliezer</b> further <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Tablets [<i>luḥot</i>] of stone”</b> (Exodus 31:18)? <b>If a person makes his cheeks [<i>leḥayav</i>] like this stone that does not wear away, his</b> Torah <b>study will endure. But if not,</b> i.e., if he is not diligent in his studies, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure.</b><br><b>And,</b> lastly, <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written:</b> “And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, <b>engraved upon the tablets”</b> (Exodus 32:16)? This teaches that <b>had the first tablets,</b> the subject of this verse, <b>not been broken, the Torah would never have been forgotten from the Jewish people,</b> as the Torah would have been engraved upon their hearts.<br><b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Had the tablets not been broken, <b>no nation or tongue would</b> ever <b>have ruled over them, as it is stated: “Engraved</b>”; <b>do not read</b> it <b>engraved</b> [<b><i>ḥarut]</i> but</b> rather <b>freedom [<i>ḥeirut</i>].</b><br>Similarly, <b>Rav Mattana said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written:</b> “The well that the princes dug out, that the nobles of the people delved, with the scepter, with their staves. <b>And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah”</b> (Numbers 21:18)? <b>If a person makes himself</b> humble <b>like this wilderness,</b> which is open to all and <b>upon which everyone treads, his</b> Torah <b>study will endure</b> and be given to him as a gift [<i>mattana</i>]. <b>And if not, his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure.</b><br>The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yosef had a grievance against Rava, son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama,</b> who is usually referred to in the Gemara simply as Rava, and as a result of the grievance the two would never meet. <b>When the eve of Yom Kippur arrived,</b> Rava <b>said: I will go and appease him. He went and found</b> Rav Yosef’s <b>attendant mixing him a cup</b> of wine. <b>He said to</b> the attendant: <b>Give</b> it <b>to me, and I will mix</b> it. <b>He gave it to</b> Rava, and Rava <b>mixed it.</b> Rav Yosef was blind and could not see his visitor, but <b>when he tasted</b> the wine <b>he said: This mixture is similar to the mixture</b> of <b>Rava, son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama,</b> who would add extra water to the wine. Rava <b>said to him: It is I.</b><br>Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Do not sit on your knees until you have explained these verses to me: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And from the wilderness to Mattanah; and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; and from Bamoth to the valley</b> in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks out toward the desert” (Numbers 21:19–20)?<br>Rava <b>said to him: If a person makes himself</b> humble <b>like this wilderness,</b> which is open to all and <b>upon which everyone treads, the Torah will be given to him as a gift [<i>mattana</i>]. And once it is given to him as a gift, he inherits it [<i>neḥalo</i>]</b> and <b>God [<i>El</i>]</b> makes it His inheritance, <b>as it is stated: “And from Mattanah to Nahaliel.” And once God has made it His inheritance, he rises to greatness, as it is stated: “And from Nahaliel to Bamoth,”</b> which means heights.<br><b>And if he becomes haughty, the Holy One, Blessed be He, lowers him, as it is stated: “And from Bamoth to the valley.” And if he repents, the Holy One, Blessed be He, raises him</b> back <b>up, as it is stated: “Every valley shall be exalted”</b> (Isaiah 40:4).<br><b>Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Your flock found a dwelling in it; You, O God, prepare of Your goodness for the poor”</b> (Psalms 68:11)? <b>If a person makes himself like an animal that tramples</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it immediately, without being particular about its food, i.e., if a scholar immediately reviews what he has heard from his teacher; <b>and some say,</b> like an animal <b>that soils and eats,</b> i.e., if a scholar is not particular about maintaining his honor during his Torah study, just as an animal is not particular about the quality of its food, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will endure. And if not, his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure. And if he does so, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will Himself prepare him a feast, as it is stated: “You, O God, prepare of Your goodness for the poor,”</b> indicating that God in His goodness will Himself prepare a feast for that pauper.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “He who guards the fig tree shall eat its fruit”</b> (Proverbs 27:18)? <b>Why were matters of Torah compared to a fig tree? Just as this fig tree,</b><br><br>Daf 54b<br><br><b>whenever a person searches it</b> for figs to eat, <b>he finds figs in it,</b> as the figs on a tree do not ripen all at once, so that one can always find a recently ripened fig, <b>so</b> too, with <b>matters of Torah. Whenever a person meditates upon them, he finds in them</b> new <b>meaning.</b><br><b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “A loving hind and a graceful roe,</b> let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and be you ravished always with her love” (Proverbs 5:19)? <b>Why were matters of Torah compared to a hind? To tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with <b>a hind, its womb is narrow and it is cherished by its mate each and every hour like the first hour, so</b> too, <b>matters of Torah are cherished by those who study them each and every hour like the first hour.</b><br><b>“And a graceful roe”</b> is expounded as follows: <b>That</b> the Torah <b>bestows grace upon those who study it. “Let her breasts satisfy you at all times”; why were matters of Torah compared to a breast? Just as</b> with <b>a breast, whenever a baby searches it</b> for milk to suckle, <b>he finds milk in it, so</b> too, with <b>matters of Torah. Whenever a person meditates upon them, he finds</b> new <b>meaning in them.</b><br><b>“And be you ravished always with her love”;</b> your love for Torah should always distract you from worldly matters, <b>as was</b> the case with <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat. They said of him, of Rabbi Elazar, that he would sit and engage in Torah</b> study <b>in the lower marketplace of Tzippori, and his cloak was lying in the upper marketplace of Tzippori.</b> His mind was so focused on Torah study that he would act in this unusual manner. In this regard, the Gemara relates that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar said: One time a person came to take</b> this cloak for himself <b>and found a serpent on it</b> guarding it.<br>In further praise of the Torah and those who study it, a Sage <b>of the school of Rav Anan taught: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “You that ride on white donkeys, you that sit on rich cloths, and you that walk by the way, tell of it”</b> (Judges 5:10)? <b>“You that ride on white donkeys”; these are Torah scholars, who travel from city to city and from province to province to study Torah. “White [<i>tzeḥorot</i>]”</b> are those <b>who make it</b> clear <b>as noon</b> [<b><i>tzahorayim</i></b>], i.e., who make the Torah comprehensible. <b>“You that sit on couches [<i>midin</i>]”</b> refers to those <b>who judge [<i>danin</i>] an absolutely true judgment. “And you that walk”; these are the masters of Bible,</b> who are the least important of the scholars. <b>“By the way”; these are the</b> more important <b>masters of Mishna. “Tell of it”; these are the masters of Talmud,</b> the most important of all, <b>as all their conversation is</b> about <b>matters of Torah.</b><br>The Gemara continues with this topic: <b>Rav Sheizvi said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The slothful man [<i>remiyya</i>] will not roast [<i>yaḥarokh</i>] his catch”</b> (Proverbs 12:27)? <b>The deceitful [<i>rammai</i>] hunter will not live [<i>yiḥyeh</i>] a long life [<i>ya’arikh</i>].</b> A deceitful hunter continues to hunt more and more animals without holding on to the animals he has already caught. Similarly, someone who continues to study new material without reviewing what he has already learned will not be successful.<br><b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> Will <b>a deceitful hunter</b> have something to <b>roast?</b> One who acts in this way is a fool, but it is hard to describe him as deceitful.<br><b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: This is comparable to a hunter who is hunting birds; if he breaks</b> the <b>wings</b> of the birds <b>one by one</b> as he captures them so that they will be unable to fly off again, his prey <b>will be secured, and if not,</b> they <b>will not be secured.</b> According to this explanation, the word <i>rammai</i> is interpreted as cunning rather than deceitful. A cunning hunter secures his prey; similarly, a cunning student reviews each lesson and thereby retains that which he learns.<br>Similarly, <b>Rabba said that Rav Seḥora said that Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Wealth gotten through vanity</b> [<b><i>hevel</i></b>] <b>shall be diminished; but he that gathers little by little shall increase”</b> (Proverbs 13:11)? <b>If a person turns his Torah into bundles</b> [<b><i>ḥavilot</i>,</b> derived from the word <i>hevel</i> by replacing the <i>heh</i> with a <i>ḥet</i>], studying large amounts at the same time, his Torah <b>will diminish. And if not,</b> i.e., if he learns little by little and reviews what he has learned, <b>he that gathers little by little shall increase.</b><br><b>Rabba said: The Sages know this, but</b> nevertheless <b>transgress it,</b> i.e., they fail to heed this advice. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I did this,</b> learning little by little and regularly reviewing what I had learned, <b>and</b> my learning <b>has</b> indeed <b>endured.</b><br>The Gemara continues to discuss methods of Torah study. <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>What was the order of teaching</b> the Oral Law? How was the Oral Law first taught? <b>Moses learned</b> directly <b>from the mouth of the Almighty. Aaron entered</b> and sat before him, <b>and Moses taught him his lesson</b> as he had learned it from God. <b>Aaron moved</b> aside <b>and sat to the left of Moses.</b> Aaron’s <b>sons entered, and Moses taught them their lesson</b> while Aaron listened. Aaron’s <b>sons moved</b> aside; <b>Elazar sat to the right of Moses and Itamar</b> sat <b>to the left of Aaron. Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagreed with the first <i>tanna</i> with regard to the seating arrangements and <b>said: Actually, Aaron would return to</b> sit to <b>the right of Moses. The elders entered and Moses taught them their lesson. The elders moved</b> aside, and <b>the entire nation entered and Moses taught them their lesson. Therefore, Aaron had</b> heard the lesson <b>four times, his sons</b> heard it <b>three</b> times, <b>the elders</b> heard it <b>twice, and the entire nation</b> heard it <b>once.</b><br><b>Moses</b> then <b>departed</b> to his tent, <b>and Aaron taught</b> the others <b>his lesson</b> as he had learned it from Moses. <b>Aaron</b> then <b>departed</b> and <b>his sons taught</b> the others <b>their lesson. His sons</b> then <b>departed</b> and <b>the elders taught</b> the rest of the people <b>their lesson. Hence everyone,</b> Aaron, his sons, the elders and all the people, heard the lesson taught by God <b>four times.</b><br><b>From here Rabbi Eliezer said: A person is obligated to teach his student</b> his lesson <b>four times. And</b> it follows by way of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If Aaron, who learned from Moses</b> himself, <b>and Moses</b> had received the Torah directly <b>from the mouth of the Almighty,</b> needed <b>this</b> regimen; <b>an ordinary</b> student learning <b>from the mouth of an ordinary</b> teacher, <b>how much more so</b> must he review his studies four times.<br><b>Rabbi Akiva says: From where</b> do we derive <b>that a person is obligated to teach his student until he learns</b> the material and understands it? <b>As it is stated:</b> “Now therefore write this song for you, <b>and teach it to the children of Israel;</b> put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). This verse indicates that one must teach Torah to others. <b>And from where</b> do we derive that one must teach his students <b>until</b> the material <b>is organized in their mouths? As it is stated: “Put it in their mouths,”</b> so that they should be capable of teaching it to others.<br><b>And from where</b> do we derive <b>that</b> a teacher <b>must show</b> his students <b>the reasons</b> for the teachings? <b>As it is stated: “Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1), which indicates that the lesson must be set out in logical fashion for the students.<br>With regard to the manner in which the Oral Law was taught, the Gemara asks: <b>They should all have studied from Moses</b> himself four times. The Gemara answers: The teaching was divided in this manner <b>in order to give honor to Aaron and his sons, and</b> also to give <b>honor to the elders.</b><br>The Gemara asks why a different method was not adopted, one which would have involved less trouble for Moses: <b>Aaron should have entered and studied from Moses; his sons should</b> then <b>have entered and studied from Aaron; the elders should</b> then <b>have entered and studied from</b> Aaron’s <b>sons; and</b> then <b>they should have gone</b> out <b>and taught all of the Jewish people.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since Moses had studied</b> directly <b>from the mouth of the Almighty, it would be</b> more <b>effective</b> for everyone to hear the Torah at least once from Moses himself.<br><b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Actually, Aaron would return to</b> sit to <b>the right of Moses,</b> i.e., no matter how many people were present Aaron always sat to Moses’ right. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>was it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> dealing with the rules of etiquette: If <b>three</b> people <b>were walking along the way, the teacher</b> should walk <b>in the middle and the greater</b> of the two students should be <b>to his right and the lesser</b> one should be <b>to his left? Shall we say</b> that <b>it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not</b> that of <b>the Sages?</b> According to the Sages, the greater of the two students should be positioned to the left of the teacher so that the student’s right side faces his teacher.<br>The Gemara answers: You can <b>even say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Sages,</b> and the reason they said that Aaron remained to Moses’ left even after the others entered is <b>due to the trouble to Aaron</b> if he would have to stand up and sit down again.<br>Having discussed the importance of reviewing one’s Torah study, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Perida had a certain student whom he would</b> have to <b>teach four hundred times, and</b> only then would he <b>learn</b> the material, as he was incapable of understanding it otherwise. <b>One day they requested</b> Rabbi Perida’s presence <b>for a mitzva matter</b> after the lesson. Rabbi Perida <b>taught</b> his student four hundred times as usual, <b>but</b> this time the student <b>did not</b> successfully <b>learn</b> the material.<br>Rabbi Perida <b>said to him: What is different now</b> that you are unable to grasp the lesson? <b>He said to him: From the time that they said to the Master</b> that <b>there is a mitzva matter</b> for which he is needed, <b>my mind was distracted</b> from the lesson <b>and every moment I said: Now the Master will get up, now the Master will get up</b> to go and perform the mitzva and he will not complete the lesson. Rabbi Perida <b>said to him: Pay attention</b> this time <b>and I will teach you,</b> and know that I will not leave until you have fully mastered the lesson. <b>He taught him again an additional four hundred times.</b><br>Due to the merit of Rabbi Perida’s great devotion to his students, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said to him:</b> Is it <b>preferable to you that four hundred years be added</b> to your life, <b>or that you and</b> the rest of <b>your generation</b> will <b>merit the World-to-Come? He said:</b> I prefer <b>that I and my generation merit the World-to-Come. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said</b> to the angels: <b>Give him both;</b> he shall live a very long life and he and the rest of his generation will merit the World-to-Come.<br>The Gemara continues its discussion with regard to methods of Torah study: <b>Rav Ḥisda said: The Torah can be acquired only with</b> mnemonic <b>signs</b> that aid the memory, <b>as it is stated: “Put it in their mouths.” Do not read</b> the phrase as: <b>Put it [<i>simah</i>], but</b> rather as: <b>Its sign [<i>simanah</i>],</b> thus indicating that mnemonic signs aid in memorizing the material.<br><b>Rav Taḥalifa of the West,</b> i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, <b>heard this</b> statement and <b>went</b> and <b>said it before Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who <b>said: You learn this</b> idea <b>from there; we learn it from here,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Set up signposts [<i>tziyyunim</i>] for yourself; establish you</b> markers” (Jeremiah 31:20), which is understood to mean: <b>Establish</b> mnemonic <b>signs for the Torah. And from where</b> may it be inferred <b>that this</b> term <b><i>tziyyun</i> denotes a sign? As it is written</b> in a different verse: “And when they that pass through shall pass through the land, <b>and any sees a human bone, he shall set up a sign</b> [<b><i>tziyyun</i></b>] <b>by it”</b> (Ezekiel 39:15), i.e., a sign that there is a source of ritual impurity at that spot.<br><b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> that we learn this same idea <b>from here: “Say to wisdom, you are my sister, and call understanding, your kinswoman [<i>moda</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 7:4), which means: <b>Establish signs [<i>moda’im</i>]</b> that convey knowledge of <b>the Torah. Rava said</b> with regard to this verse: <b>Set appointed times [<i>mo’adim</i>] for Torah</b> study.<br><br></body></html>
