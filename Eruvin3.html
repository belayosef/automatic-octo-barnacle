Daf 3a<br><br><b>a</b> molded or protruding <b>cornice [<i>amaltera</i>]</b> crowning the entrance <b>should not be effective</b> in rendering an alleyway fit to carry within it if it is higher than twenty cubits, <b>as the Sanctuary had a cornice, and even so</b> it was <b>twenty cubits high,</b> and no more. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Over it were five oak cornices, one</b> protruding <b>above the other.</b><br>The Gemara attempts to dismiss this difficulty: <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> mishna, <b>what is the refutation? Perhaps when that</b> mishna <b>with regard to cornices was taught, it was taught with regard to the Entrance Hall,</b> whose height was forty cubits, and not with regard to the Sanctuary.<br>The Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty</b> with <b>that? Perhaps the design of the Sanctuary was like the design of the Entrance Hall.</b> Just as there were cornices in one doorway, there were cornices in the other.<br>The Gemara returns to its question with regard to a cornice: <b>Why</b> then <b>did Rabbi Ile’a say</b> that <b>Rav</b> himself <b>said:</b> If the <b>width</b> of a cross beam is <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>even if it is not sturdy,</b> it renders the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <b>And if it has a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, one need not diminish</b> its height.<br><b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>cornice</b> was not actually stated by Rav, but rather it <b>is a <i>baraita</i>. Who,</b> in fact, <b>teaches</b> that <i>baraita</i>? Perhaps it is not an authoritative <i>baraita</i>, and Rav does not have to accept what it says.<br><b>Abaye said: Isn’t it Ḥama, son of Rabba bar Avuh, who teaches it? And</b> therefore, even if the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>cornice will be a <i>baraita</i>, it</b> nevertheless <b>poses a difficulty to Rav.</b><br><b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> Even if you <b>eliminate me</b> and my explanation <b>from</b> the discussion <b>here, don’t the</b> two <b><i>baraitot</i></b> themselves, the <i>baraita</i> that states that the Rabbis derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Sanctuary and the <i>baraita</i> that states that in the case of a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, it need not be lowered, <b>contradict each other? Rather, what have you to say</b> to reconcile the contradiction? The matter is the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>; so too, according to my</b> opinion, it <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b><br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Without Rav, the <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict each other,</b> as <b>according to the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> that <b>a</b> cross <b>beam</b> renders an alleyway fit for carrying? Because it serves <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> between the alleyway and the public domain. Ordinarily a cross beam more than twenty cubits high is not noticeable; however, a cornice attracts attention even at that height. <b>And that which is taught</b> in the other <i>baraita</i> with regard to the height of a beam at the entrance to an alleyway: <b>Greater than the entrance of the Sanctuary,</b> is <b>merely</b> a <b>mnemonic</b> device. No actual <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the entrance of the Sanctuary.<br>The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that the explanation of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak works out well if he does not hold this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba; however, if he holds this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba,</b> it is difficult. As <b>Rabba said</b> with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> whose roofing is higher than twenty cubits that <b>it is written: “In order that your generations should know that I made</b> the children of Israel <b>dwell in booths</b> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 23:43). When the roofing of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person is aware that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>;</b> however, when the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is <b>above twenty cubits, a person is not aware</b> that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>, <b>because the eye does not discern</b> the <i>sukka</i> roofing. One does not usually raise his head to look that high, and consequently, he sees the walls and does not notice the defining feature of the <i>sukka</i>, its roofing.<br>The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Apparently, with regard to <i>sukka</i> as well,</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree</b> whether or not an item more than twenty cubits high is <b>conspicuous.</b> According to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, <b>why do I</b> need them to <b>disagree</b> about the same point <b>in two cases,</b> that of <i>sukka</i> and that of an alleyway? That the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to <i>sukka</i> revolves around this issue indicates that their dispute with regard to an alleyway revolves around a different point, as asserted by Rav.<br>The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach both disputes, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to <i>sukka</i>,</b> one might have thought that only <b>in this</b> case does <b>Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that an object is conspicuous even above twenty cubits; <b>since</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>is designed for</b> extended <b>dwelling, the eye</b> undoubtedly <b>discerns</b> the roofing at some point. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>an alleyway,</b> which <b>is designed for walking, say</b> that <b>he concedes to</b> the <b>Rabbis</b> that a person walking in an alleyway does not notice objects at so significant a height. <b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case of an alleyway, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case do <b>the Rabbis say</b> that people do not notice objects at so significant a height; <b>however, in that</b> case of <i>sukka</i>, <b>say</b> that <b>they concede to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> for the above-stated reason. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both disputes.<br>The Gemara seeks to arrive at a precise definition of <i>amaltera</i>, translated above as cornice. <b>What</b> is <b>an <i>amaltera</i>? Rav Ḥama, son of Rabba bar Avuh, said:</b> It refers to decorative wood carvings in the shape of <b>birds’ nests. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, it is referring to <b>cedar poles.</b><br>The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that <i>amaltera</i> refers to <b>cedar poles</b> would <b>all the more so</b> permit use of carvings of <b>birds’ nests,</b> as a cross beam engraved with images attracts attention and is noticeable even at a great height. However, <b>the one who said</b> that <i>amaltera</i> refers to carvings of <b>birds’ nests</b> would say that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a cornice applies only to them, <b>but not to cedar poles.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies the opinion of <b>the one who said cedar poles. What is</b> the <b>reason</b> for his opinion? He holds that <b>since its length is great,</b> a cedar pole attracts attention. <b>But isn’t the length of a <i>sukka</i> great</b> as well, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Rabbis say that</b> a <i>sukka</i> higher than twenty cubits is <b>not</b> fit?<br><b>Rather,</b> the reason is as follows: <b>Since</b> a cedar pole <b>is</b> of <b>significant</b> value, <b>it</b> generates <b>publicity.</b> People passing through an alleyway stop and stare at a cross beam of that kind, even when it is higher than twenty cubits, leading others to do so as well.<br>The Gemara raises a question: If <b>part of the</b> cross <b>beam</b> of an alleyway is <b>within twenty</b> cubits of the ground, <b>and part of the</b> cross <b>beam</b> is <b>above twenty</b> cubits, and similarly, if <b>part of the roofing</b> of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>within twenty</b> cubits, <b>and part of the roofing</b> is <b>above twenty</b> cubits, what is its legal status? <b>Rabba said: In</b> the case of <b>an alleyway, it is fit; in</b> the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, it is unfit.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is different in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that the ruling is <b>that it is fit?</b> It is because <b>we say: Thin</b> the part of the cross beam that is beyond twenty cubits, i.e., consider it as if it were not there. If so, in the case of <b><i>sukka</i> too, say: Thin</b> the roofing that is beyond twenty cubits.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>If you thin</b> the roofing beyond twenty cubits, <b>it will result in</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose sun is more than its shade.</b> Were the section of the roofing above twenty cubits removed, the roofing that remained would not provide sufficient shade for the <i>sukka</i>.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a cross beam, <b>if you thin</b> the section above twenty cubits, <b>it would become a</b> weak and unstable cross <b>beam that is removed by the wind,</b> which does not render the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <b>Rather, perforce,</b> the status of the remaining parts of those cross beams <b>becomes like</b> that of <b>metal skewers [<i>shefudin</i>],</b> which, although they are thin, are not removed by the wind. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a <i>sukka</i>, <b>perforce,</b> even after the upper roofing is removed, the status of the <i>sukka</i> <b>becomes like</b> that of a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose shade is more than its sun.</b><br>The Gemara explains Rabba’s distinction differently. <b>Rava from Parzakya said: A <i>sukka</i>, which is</b> generally erected <b>for an individual,</b> if the portion of the roofing below twenty were removed and only the portion above twenty remained, <b>he</b> would <b>not be reminded</b> to lower the remaining roofing and would dwell in a <i>sukka</i> that is unfit. <b>An alleyway,</b> in contrast, <b>which is</b> used by <b>many</b> people, if the section of the cross beam below twenty cubits were removed, <b>they</b> would <b>remind each other</b> to remedy the situation.<br><b>Ravina said</b> a different explanation: <b>With regard to a <i>sukka</i>,</b> since its mitzva <b>is by Torah law, the Sages were stringent.</b> However, <b>with regard to an alleyway,</b> since the entire requirement to place a cross beam across the entrance in order to permit carrying in an alleyway <b>is</b> only <b>by rabbinic law, the Sages were not stringent.</b><br>The Gemara cites a different version of Rabba’s distinction: <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana taught this <i>halakha</i> of Rabba</b> in the <b>opposite</b> manner. <b>Rabba said: In</b> the case of <b>an alleyway, it is unfit; in</b> the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, it is fit.</b> As a result, all the previous explanations must be reversed.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is different in</b> the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i></b> that <b>it is fit?</b> Because <b>we say: Thin</b> the roofing that is beyond twenty cubits. If so, then <b>in</b> the case of <b>a</b> cross <b>beam as well, let us say: Thin</b> the part of the cross beam that is beyond twenty cubits.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>If you thin</b> the part beyond twenty cubits, <b>it will become a</b> weak and unstable cross <b>beam that moves in the wind.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a <i>sukka</i>, <b>if you thin</b> the upper section of the roofing, <b>it would become</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose sun is more than its shade. Rather, perforce,</b> even after the upper roofing is removed, the status of the <i>sukka</i> <b>becomes like</b> that of a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose shade is more than its sun; here too,</b> in the case of an alleyway, <b>perforce,</b> the status of the remaining parts of those cross beams <b>becomes like</b> that of <b>metal skewers,</b> which, although they are thin, do not move in the wind.<br>The Gemara offers a different explanation of Rabba’s distinction: <b>Rava from Parzakya said:</b> In the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which is</b> generally erected <b>for an individual, he casts</b> responsibility <b>upon himself and is reminded</b> to make certain that the roofing is fit. In the case of <b>an alleyway, which is</b> used by <b>many</b> people, <b>they</b> are likely to <b>rely upon each other and are not reminded</b> to check the height of the cross beam. <b>As people say: A pot</b> belonging to <b>partners is neither hot nor cold.</b> When responsibility falls upon more than one person, each relies on the other, and ultimately the task is not completed.<br><b>Ravina</b> offered a different explanation and <b>said:</b> The mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> which <b>is by Torah law, does not require reinforcement</b> by the Sages, and consequently, they were lenient in that case. However, since the entire requirement to place a cross beam across the entrance to <b>an alleyway is by rabbinic law,</b> it <b>requires reinforcement,</b> and therefore the Sages were stringent.<br>Since there are two contradictory versions of Rabba’s statement, the Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> practical conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about this</b> problem, if part of the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> or the cross beam was above twenty cubits? <b>Rabba bar Rav Ulla said:</b> In that case, both <b>this,</b> an alleyway, <b>and that,</b> a <i>sukka</i>, <b>are unfit. Rava said:</b> Both <b>this and that are fit,</b><br><br>Daf 3b<br><br>as that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna, with regard to the unfitness of a <i>sukka</i> higher than twenty cubits, is referring to the interior <b>space of the <i>sukka</i>;</b> and that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna, that a cross beam spanning an alleyway that is more than twenty cubits must be lowered, is referring to the <b>space</b> at the entrance <b>of the alleyway</b> beneath the cross beam.<br><b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught that supports your</b> opinion: If the cross beam spanning the entrance of <b>an alleyway is higher than twenty cubits</b> off the ground, <b>greater than the entrance of the Sanctuary, one must diminish its</b> height. <b>And the space of the</b> entrance of the <b>Sanctuary itself was twenty</b> cubits high, and its roof was higher than twenty cubits. Apparently, the twenty cubits mentioned with regard to a <i>sukka</i> and an alleyway refers to the space beneath the roofing and the cross beam.<br><b>Rav Shimi bar Rav Ashi raised an objection to Rav Pappa</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>How</b> precisely <b>would he do it? He places the</b> cross <b>beam from the edge of twenty</b> cubits <b>and below.</b> Apparently, the entire cross beam must be within twenty cubits of the ground, and if any part of it rises above twenty it is unfit.<br>Rav Pappa replied: Emend the <i>Tosefta</i> and <b>say:</b> From the edge of twenty cubits <b>and above.</b> Rav Shimi retorted: <b>But isn’t it taught:</b> And <b>below?</b> What justification is there to completely reverse the meaning of the <i>Tosefta</i>?<br>Rava explained that there is no need to emend the language of the <i>baraita</i>, but merely to reinterpret it. The <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching us the following:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>below is like</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>above. Just as above,</b> with regard to the maximum height of the cross beam, it is the <b>space</b> beneath the cross beam that may not be more than <b>twenty</b> cubits, <b>so</b> too <b>below,</b> with regard to the minimum height of the cross beam, it is the <b>space</b> beneath the cross beam that may not be less than <b>ten</b> handbreadths. However, a cross beam placed within ten handbreadths of the ground is unfit and does not render it permitted to carry within the alleyway.<br>The Gemara considers the measure of the cubit mentioned in the mishna and elsewhere. <b>Abaye said in the name of Rav Naḥman: The cubit</b> mentioned with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of <i>sukka</i> and the cubit</b> mentioned in connection with the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of an alleyway</b> is <b>a</b> small <b>cubit</b> consisting <b>of five</b> handbreadths. In contrast, <b>the cubit of</b> a forbidden mixture of <b>diverse kinds</b> of seeds is <b>a</b> large <b>cubit</b> consisting <b>of six</b> handbreadths. Apparently, Rav Naḥman rules stringently in all cases.<br>The Gemara elaborates: <b>The cubit of an alleyway is a cubit</b> consisting <b>of five</b> handbreadths. <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> does this ruling apply? It applies <b>to</b> the issue of the height of the cross beam spanning an alleyway that may not be more than twenty cubits high, <b>and to the breach of an alleyway</b> that may not be more than ten cubits wide.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the issue of <b>the</b> minimal <b>length of an alleyway?</b> For carrying in an alleyway to be rendered permissible by means of a side post or a cross beam, it must be at least <b>four cubits</b> long. In that case, measuring the alleyway with small cubits will lead <b>to a leniency.</b><br>The Gemara resolves this difficulty: Rav Naḥman holds <b>in accordance with the one who said</b> that the length of an alleyway need only be <b>four handbreadths.</b> However, a cubit mentioned in the context of an alleyway is always a small cubit, which is a stringency.<br>The Gemara proposes an alternative solution: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that actually Rav Naḥman holds in accordance with the opinion that the length of an alleyway must be <b>four cubits,</b> and in that case, the alleyway is measured with large cubits of six handbreadths as a stringency. When he is saying that the cubit of an alleyway is a cubit of five handbreadths, <b>he is speaking of most,</b> but not all, <b>cubits</b> mentioned in the context of an alleyway.<br>Rav Naḥman said that <b>the cubit of a <i>sukka</i></b> is <b>a</b> small <b>cubit</b> consisting <b>of five</b> handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> does this ruling apply? It applies <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>its height,</b> i.e., that a <i>sukka</i> may not be more than twenty cubits high, <b>and to the</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>a curved wall.</b> A <i>sukka</i> is considered valid if there are up to four cubits of invalid roofing, provided that this roofing is adjacent to one of the walls of the <i>sukka</i>. In that case, the invalid roofing is considered an extension of the wall, i.e., the wall is considered to be curved, and consequently, the entire <i>sukka</i> is valid. With regard to both <i>halakhot</i>, the ruling is stringent and distance is measured with small cubits.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the</b> minimal <b>length of a <i>sukka</i>,</b> which must be at least <b>four cubits</b> long? If it is measured with small cubits, <b>that</b> will lead <b>to a leniency. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say, any <i>sukka</i> that does not</b> have <b>in it</b> an area of at least <b>four cubits by four cubits is invalid.</b><br>The Gemara resolves this difficulty: Rav Naḥman holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say:</b> A <i>sukka</i> is valid <b>even if it holds only one’s head, most of his</b> body, <b>and his table.</b><br>The Gemara suggests another solution: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement holds true even if <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that a <i>sukka</i> must be at least four cubits long. Indeed, the <i>sukka</i> is measured with large cubits consisting of six handbreadths, which is a stringency. <b>And</b> when he says that the cubit of a <i>sukka</i> is a cubit of five handbreadths, <b>he is speaking of most,</b> but not all, <b>cubits</b> mentioned with regard to <i>sukka</i>.<br>The Gemara continues: As stated above, Rav Naḥman said that <b>the cubit of a</b> forbidden mixture of <b>diverse kinds</b> of seeds <b>is a cubit</b> consisting <b>of six handbreadths.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> does this ruling apply? It applies <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a clearing in a vineyard and to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the perimeter of a vineyard.</b><br><b>As we learned</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Kilayim</i>: With regard to <b>a clearing in a vineyard, Beit Shammai say:</b> Its measure is <b>twenty-four cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Sixteen cubits.</b> With regard to <b>the perimeter of a vineyard, Beit Shammai say: Sixteen cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Twelve cubits.</b><br>The mishna explains: <b>What is a clearing in a vineyard?</b> It is referring to <b>a vineyard whose middle</b> section <b>was laid bare</b> of vines. If <b>there are not sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there,</b> due to the Torah prohibition against sowing other crops in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). If <b>there were sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one provides</b> the vineyard with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> i.e., four cubits along either side of the vines are left unsown to facilitate cultivation of the vines, <b>and he sows the rest</b> of the cleared area with foreign crops.<br>The mishna continues: <b>What is the perimeter of a vineyard?</b> It is the vacant area <b>between the vineyard and the fence</b> surrounding it. If <b>there are not twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there.</b> If <b>there were twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>he provides</b> the vineyard, with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> four cubits, <b>and he sows the rest.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the <i>halakha</i> of vines that planted <b>consecutively, within four cubits</b> of each other, with regard to <b>which</b> measuring the distance with large cubits would lead <b>to a leniency? As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a vineyard that was planted</b> in consecutive rows <b>with less than four cubits</b> between them, <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Since the rows are planted so closely together, <b>it is not</b> considered <b>a vineyard,</b> and if one plants other crops there he is not liable. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>a vineyard, and one regards the middle</b> vines, those planted between two appropriately spaced rows, <b>as if they are not</b> there. One who plants other crops there is indeed liable. According to Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, measuring the distance between the rows with large cubits leads to leniency.<br>The Gemara resolves the difficulty: Rav Naḥman made his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that a densely planted vineyard <b>is a vineyard. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement holds true even if <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> that a densely planted vineyard is not a vineyard, and the distance between the rows is measured with small cubits consisting of five handbreadths as a stringency. When he says that the cubit of diverse kinds of seeds is a cubit consisting of six handbreadths, <b>he is speaking of most,</b> but not all, <b>cubits</b> mentioned with regard to a forbidden mixture of diverse kinds of seeds.<br>The above was based on the ruling of Rav Naḥman according to Abaye. <b>But Rava said in the name of Rav Naḥman: All cubits</b> mentioned in measurements by the Sages consisted of a large <b>cubit of six</b> handbreadths. <b>However, these,</b> the cubits mentioned with regard to diverse kinds of seeds, <b>are</b> measured with <b>expansive</b> handbreadths, with the fingers spread apart, <b>whereas those,</b> the cubits mentioned with regard to an alleyway and a <i>sukka</i>, <b>are</b> measured with <b>compressed</b> handbreadths, with the fingers held together.<br><b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All cubits that were mentioned by the Sages are cubits of six</b> handbreadths, <b>provided</b><br><br></body></html>
