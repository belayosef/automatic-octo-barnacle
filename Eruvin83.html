Daf 83a<br><br>A Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And half of one half of its half,</b> one-eighth of this loaf, is the minimum measure of food that <b>contracts the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And our <i>tanna</i>,</b> in the mishna, for <b>what reason</b> did <b>he did not teach</b> the measure of <b>the impurity of foods?</b> The Gemara answers: He did not state this <i>halakha</i> <b>because their measures are not</b> precisely <b>identical.</b> The measure for the impurity of foods is not exactly half the amount of ritually impure food that disqualifies one from eating <i>teruma</i>.<br><b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much is half a <i>peras</i>? Two eggs minus a little;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: Two large eggs,</b> slightly larger ones than average. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>measured</b> the amount of half a <i>peras</i> after calculating the number of <i>kav</i> in the <i>se’a</i> brought before him, and found it to be <b>a little more than two eggs.</b> The <i>tanna</i> asks: <b>How much</b> is this <b>little more? One-twentieth of an egg.</b><br><b>In contrast, concerning the impurity of foods, it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Dosa said</b> that the measure of <b>an egg-bulk, which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> is the amount that contracts the impurity of foods, is <b>equivalent to it,</b> i.e., the egg, <b>and its shell. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>equivalent to it without its shell.</b> These amounts are not precisely half of any of the measurements given for half a <i>peras</i>.<br>As for the issue itself, <b>Rafram bar Pappa said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: This</b> <i>baraita</i> that clarifies the measure of half a <i>peras</i> is in accordance with <b>the statements of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei,</b> a measure that is identical to that of Rabbi Shimon in the mishna. <b>But the Rabbis say: One and one half large egg-bulks. And who are</b> these <b>Rabbis? Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.</b><br>The Gemara registers surprise: This is <b>obvious,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka maintains that half a loaf is three egg-bulks, half of which is an egg-bulk and one half. The Gemara explains: The novel aspect of this teaching is not the amount itself; rather, <b>he came to teach us</b> that the measurement is performed with <b>large eggs.</b><br>The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> A person named <b>Bonyos sent Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>a measure [</b><i>modya</i><b>] of a <i>se’a</i> from</b> a place called <b>Na’usa,</b> where they had a tradition that it was an ancient and accurate measure (Ritva). <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>measured</b> it and found it contained <b>217 eggs.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>This <i>se’a</i>, from where</b> is it, i.e., on what measure is it based? <b>If</b> it is based on <b>the wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>, the standard measure used by Moses in the wilderness, which is the basis for all the Torah’s measurements of volume, the difficulty is that a <i>se’a</i> is composed of six <i>kav</i>, where each <i>kav</i> is equivalent to four <i>log</i> and each <i>log</i> is equivalent to six egg-bulks. This means that a <i>se’a</i> <b>is</b> equivalent to a total of <b>144</b> egg-bulks.<br><b>And if</b> it is <b>the Jerusalem</b> <i>se’a</i>, then the <i>se’a</i> <b>is</b> only <b>173</b> egg-bulks, as they enlarged the measures in Jerusalem by adding a fifth to the measures of the wilderness.<br><b>And if</b> it is a <i>se’a</i> <b>of Tzippori,</b> as the measures were once again increased in Tzippori, where another fifth was added to the Jerusalem measure, the <i>se’a</i> <b>is 207</b> egg-bulks. The <i>se’a</i> measured by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not correspond to any of these measures of a <i>se’a</i>.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this measure is based <b>on the</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>of Tzippori,</b> but you must <b>bring</b> the amount of <b>the <i>ḥalla</i></b> given to a priest, <b>and add it to them.</b> That is to say, although this measure is slightly larger than a <i>se’a</i>, if it is used for flour and you deduct the amount due as <i>ḥalla</i>, you are left with exactly one <i>se’a</i>, or 207 egg-bulks.<br>The Gemara raises an objection: The amount of <b><i>ḥalla</i>, how many</b> egg-bulks <b>is it?</b> Approximately <b>eight</b> egg-bulks, one-twenty-fourth of 207. Yet in that case, <b>it remains less</b> than 217 egg-bulks, for even if we were to add another eight egg-bulks for <i>ḥalla</i> to the 207 egg-bulks, we would have only 215 egg-bulks, almost 216 to be more precise, which is still less than 217.<br><b>Rather,</b> you must <b>bring</b> the <b>excess</b> amounts of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the little more he included in his measure, <b>and add</b> these <b>to them.</b> In Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s calculations, he did not factor in the <i>ḥalla</i> that had to be separated. Instead, the egg-bulks he used to measure the <i>se’a</i> were small egg-bulks. Consequently, one-twentieth of an egg-bulk must be added for each egg-bulk. Since one-twentieth of 207 egg-bulks is roughly ten, the total amount equals 217 egg-bulks.<br>The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so, it is</b> still slightly <b>more</b> than 217 egg-bulks, by seven-twentieths of an egg-bulk, to be precise. The Gemara answers: <b>Since it is not</b> more than 217 egg-bulks by <b>a</b> whole <b>egg, he did not count it.</b><br><b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A Jerusalem <i>se’a</i> is larger than a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>by one-sixth, and that of Tzippori is larger than a Jerusalem</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>by one-sixth. Consequently,</b> a <i>se’a</i> <b>of Tzippori is larger than a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>by one-third.</b><br>The Gemara inquires: <b>One-third of which</b> measurement? <b>If you say</b> it means <b>one-third of a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>now</b> you must consider: <b>One-third of a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>how much is it? Forty-eight</b> egg-bulks, and <b>yet the difference</b> between the wilderness <i>se’a</i> and the Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is <b>sixty-three</b> egg-bulks. As stated above, a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is 207 egg-bulks, whereas a wilderness <i>se’a</i> is only 144 egg-bulks.<br><b>But rather,</b> this one-third mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>one-third of a Jerusalem</b> <i>se’a</i>, which is 173 egg-bulks, as stated above. The Gemara again examines the calculation: <b>One-third of that</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>how much is it? Fifty-eight less one-third,</b> and <b>yet the difference</b> between the wilderness and the Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is <b>sixty-three. Rather,</b> you must say that it is referring to one-third of a <b>Tzippori</b> <i>se’a</i>. <b>One-third of that</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>how much is it? Seventy less one-third,</b> and <b>yet the difference</b> between the wilderness <i>se’a</i> and the Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is <b>sixty-three</b> egg-bulks. The difference between the measures is not exactly one-third according to any of the known <i>se’a</i> measurements.<br><b>Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Consequently, a <i>se’a</i> of Tzippori is larger than a wilderness <i>se’a</i></b> by sixty-three egg-bulks, which is <b>close to one-third of</b> a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> of sixty-nine egg-bulks. <b>And one-third of it,</b> sixty-nine egg-bulks, <b>is close to half of a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> of seventy-two egg-bulks.<br><b>Ravina raised an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Does</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>state</b> either: <b>Close</b> to one-third of a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> or: <b>Close</b> to half of a wilderness <i>se’a</i>? The wording of the <i>baraita</i> indicates an exact amount. <b>Rather, Ravina said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Consequently, one-third of a Tzippori</b> <i>se’a</i> together <b>with the excess</b> amounts <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is greater than half</b> of <b>a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> of seventy-two egg-bulks by only <b>one-third of an egg.</b> In other words, a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> of 207 egg-bulks added to the excess amounts of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi of one-twentieth of an egg-bulk for each egg-bulk amounts to a total of 217 egg-bulks, one-third of which is seventy-two and one-third egg-bulks.<br><b>Our Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “You shall set apart a cake of <b>the first of your dough</b> as a gift; like the gift of the threshing floor, so shall you set it apart” (Numbers 15:20).<br><br>Daf 83b<br><br>What is the quantity of dough from which <i>ḥalla</i> must be separated? <b>The amount of “your dough.” And how much is “your dough”?</b> This amount is left unspecified by the verse. The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the amount of the dough of the wilderness.</b> The Gemara again asks: <b>And how much is the dough of the wilderness?</b><br>The Gemara responds: The Torah states that the manna, the dough of the wilderness, was “an <i>omer</i> a head” (Exodus 16:16). A later verse elaborates on that measure, <b>as it is written: “And an <i>omer</i> is the tenth part of an <i>eifa</i>”</b> (Exodus 16:36). An <i>eifa</i> is three <i>se’a</i>, which are eighteen <i>kav</i> or seventy-two <i>log</i>. An <i>omer</i> is one-tenth of this measure. <b>From here,</b> this calculation, Sages <b>said</b> that dough prepared from <b>seven quarters</b> of a <i>kav</i> of <b>flour and more is obligated in <i>ḥalla</i>. This is equal to six</b> quarter-<i>kav</i> of the <b>Jerusalem</b> measure, <b>which is five</b> quarter-<i>kav</i> of the <b>Tzippori</b> measure.<br><b>From here</b> the Sages also <b>said: One who eats roughly this amount</b> each day, <b>is healthy,</b> as he is able to eat a proper meal; <b>and</b> he is also <b>blessed,</b> as he is not a glutton who requires more. One who eats <b>more than this</b> is <b>a glutton,</b> while one who eats <b>less than this has damaged bowels</b> and must see to his health.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If both <b>the residents of</b> houses that open directly into <b>a courtyard and the residents of</b> apartments that open onto <b>a balcony</b> from which stairs lead down to that courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> between them, <b>anything</b> in the courtyard <b>that is ten handbreadths high,</b> e.g., a mound or a post, is part <b>of the balcony.</b> The residents of the apartments open to the balcony may transfer objects to and from their apartments onto the mound or post. Any post or mound that is <b>lower than this</b> height is part <b>of the courtyard.</b><br>A similar <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>an embankment</b> that surrounds <b>a cistern or a rock:</b> If the embankments that surround a cistern or rock are <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> they belong <b>to the balcony;</b> if they are <b>lower than this,</b> they may be used only <b>by</b> the inhabitants of <b>the courtyard.</b><br><b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that anything higher than ten handbreadths belongs to the balcony, <b>stated?</b> When the mound or embankment is <b>near</b> the balcony. <b>But in</b> a case where the embankment or mound is <b>distant</b> from it, <b>even</b> if it is <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> the right to use the embankment or mound goes <b>to</b> the members of <b>the courtyard. And what is</b> considered <b>near? Anything that is not four handbreadths removed</b> from the balcony.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that if the residents of two courtyards established separate <i>eiruvin</i>, and the residents of both courtyards have convenient access to a certain area, the residents of <b>this</b> courtyard <b>through an entrance, and</b> the residents of <b>that</b> courtyard <b>through</b> another <b>entrance, this is</b> similar to the case of <b>a window between two courtyards.</b> If the residents did not establish a joint <i>eiruv</i>, the use of this window is prohibited to the residents of both courtyards.<br>It is similarly obvious that if a place can be used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing</b> an object onto it <b>and</b> by the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing,</b> but it cannot be conveniently used by either set of residents, then <b>this is</b> equivalent to the case of <b>a wall between two courtyards.</b> If there is a wall between two courtyards, it may not be used by either courtyard. Likewise, if a place can be used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard only <b>by lowering</b> an object down to it <b>and</b> by the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard <b>by</b> a similar act of <b>lowering, this is</b> comparable to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a ditch between two courtyards,</b> which may not be used by the residents of either courtyard.<br>It is likewise obvious that in a place that can be conveniently used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard <b>through an entrance but</b> can be used by the residents of <b>that</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing</b> an object onto it, <b>this is</b> governed by the ruling <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> who said that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This place may be used only by those who have access to the area by way of an entrance. Likewise, a place that can be conveniently used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard <b>through an entrance but</b> can be used by the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard only <b>by lowering</b> an object down to it, <b>this is</b> governed by the ruling <b>of Rav Sheizvi,</b> who said <b>that Rav Naḥman said:</b> This place may be used only by those who have convenient access to it.<br>The ruling in each of the aforementioned cases is clear. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning a place that can be used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard only <b>by lowering</b> an object down to it <b>and by</b> the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing</b> an object on top of it? In other words, if an area is lower than one courtyard but higher than the other, so that neither set of residents has convenient access to it, which of them is entitled to use it?<br><b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>both</b> sets of residents to use it. As the use of the area is equally inconvenient to the residents of both courtyards, they retain equal rights to it and render it prohibited for the other group to use. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The use of the area <b>is granted to those who</b> can reach it <b>by lowering, as</b> it is relatively easy <b>for them</b> to lower objects to it, and therefore <b>its use is</b> more <b>convenient;</b> whereas <b>for the others,</b> who must throw onto it, <b>its use is</b> more <b>demanding. And</b> there is a principle concerning Shabbat: <b>Anything whose use is convenient for one</b> party <b>and</b> more <b>demanding for another</b> party, <b>one provides it to that</b> one <b>whose use</b> of it <b>is convenient.</b><br>In order to decide between these two opinions, the Gemara attempts to adduce a proof from the mishna: If <b>the residents of</b> houses that open directly into <b>a courtyard and the residents of</b> apartments that open onto <b>a balcony</b> from which stairs lead down to that courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> between them, <b>anything</b> in the courtyard <b>that is ten handbreadths high</b> belongs <b>to the balcony,</b> while anything that is <b>less than this</b> height belongs <b>to the courtyard.</b><br>The Gemara first explains: <b>It might have entered your mind</b> to say: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the <b>balcony</b> mentioned in the mishna?<br><br></body></html>
