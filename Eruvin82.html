Daf 82a<br><br><b>Are you raising a contradiction between</b> the opinion of <b>one person and</b> that of <b>another?</b> In other words, a difficulty cannot be raised from the statement of one <i>amora</i> against those of another. <b>One Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>maintains</b> that Rabbi Yehuda and the Sages <b>disagree, and one</b> other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <b>maintains</b> that they <b>do not disagree.</b><br>The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi cited in the course of the previous discussion. With regard to <b>the matter itself: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>any place where Rabbi Yehuda says when, or in what</b> case <b>are these, in the Mishna, he</b> intends <b>only to explain the</b> earlier <b>statement of the Rabbis,</b> not to disagree with them. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The term <b>when</b> indicates that Rabbi Yehuda comes <b>to explain,</b> but the phrase <b>in what</b> case is this, indicates that he intends <b>to disagree.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is</b> the word <b>when</b> invariably a sign that Rabbi Yehuda merely seeks <b>to explain? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>The following</b> people <b>are disqualified</b> by the Sages from giving testimony, as they are people who commit transgressions for profit: <b>One who plays with dice [<i>kubiyya</i>]</b> for money, <b>and one who lends</b> money <b>at interest, and those who fly pigeons,</b> i.e., people who arrange competitions between pigeons while placing wagers on which bird will fly faster. The reason for their disqualification is that those who play games of chance do not fully relinquish ownership of their gambling money, as they expect to win their bet. Consequently, one who accepts money in such circumstances has effectively taken something that the giver has not wholeheartedly handed over, and he is therefore like a robber, at least by rabbinic decree. The list of those disqualified from giving testimony includes <b>merchants</b> who trade in the produce <b>of the Sabbatical Year,</b> which may be eaten but may not be sold as an object of commerce.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is this so? <b>When he has no occupation other than this</b> one, <b>but if he has a</b> worthy <b>occupation other than this,</b> although he also earns money by these means, <b>this</b> person <b>is qualified</b> to give testimony. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that one who earns money by means of games of chance is not a criminal or a robber. Rather, the reason why these people are disqualified from giving testimony is because they are not occupied in the constructive development of the world. As they earn their money without effort, they do not care about the monetary losses of others. Consequently, if they have any other occupation, they are valid witnesses.<br>The Gemara resumes its difficulty: According to the above principle with regard to statements introduced with the term when, Rabbi Yehuda’s statement should be understood merely as an explanation of the previous opinion. However, <b>a <i>baraita</i> was taught about</b> the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say: Whether he has no occupation other than this</b> one, <b>or whether he has a</b> fitting <b>occupation other than this, this</b> person <b>is disqualified</b> from giving testimony. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is disagreeing rather than explaining, even though he introduced his statement with the term when.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> opinion in the <i>baraita</i>, with regard to those disqualified from providing testimony, is not the opinion of the Rabbis of the mishna. Rather, <b>it is</b> that <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintained that <b>Rabbi Tarfon said</b> this opinion. The Rabbis of the mishna, however, agree with Rabbi Yehuda in this regard, and his statement serves to explain their position.<br><b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to naziriteship: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Tarfon:</b> In a case where two people accepted a bet, with each undertaking to become a nazirite if he lost the wager, and a doubt arose as to who won, <b>neither one</b> of them <b>can possibly be a nazirite, as there is no</b> acceptance of <b>naziriteship without</b> clear and definitive <b>pronunciation.</b> A vow of naziriteship is only binding if it was expressly pronounced, i.e., if it was clear from the outset that the person intended to become a nazirite.<br><b>Consequently,</b> it can be inferred that <b>since he is in doubt</b> as to <b>whether he is a nazirite or he is not a nazirite, he does not submit himself</b> to and accept his vow of naziriteship. <b>Here, too,</b> Rabbi Yehuda disqualifies those who play games of chance from delivering testimony due to the fact that they are robbers. <b>Since</b> the player <b>does not know whether he will</b> win and <b>acquire</b> the money <b>or whether he will</b> lose and <b>not acquire</b> it, <b>he does not fully transfer ownership</b> of the money with which he plays to others, which means that the one who gains from these games receives money that was not wholeheartedly given to him. He is therefore likened to a robber, at least on the rabbinic level, which disqualifies him from giving testimony.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How does one participate in</b> the joining of Shabbat <b>boundaries?</b> One who wishes to establish a joining of Shabbat boundaries for himself and others <b>places a barrel</b> of food in the location he designates as their place of residence, <b>and says: This is for all the residents of my town, for anyone who</b> wishes to <b>go</b> on Shabbat <b>to a house of mourning or to a house of</b> a wedding <b>feast</b> situated beyond the Shabbat limit. <b>Anyone who accepted upon himself while it was still day,</b> i.e., before the onset of Shabbat, that he will rely on the <i>eiruv</i>, <b>is permitted</b> to rely upon it; but if one did so only <b>after nightfall,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> to rely upon it, as the principle is that <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> after nightfall.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef said: One may establish a joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries <b>only for the purpose of a mitzva,</b> i.e., to enable the fulfillment of a religious obligation, but not for an optional activity. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> novel element <b>is he teaching us</b> by this? <b>We</b> explicitly <b>learned</b> this idea in the mishna from the phrase: <b>For anyone who</b> wishes to <b>go</b> on Shabbat <b>to a house of mourning or to a house of a</b> wedding <b>feast.</b> This mishna indicates that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established only for the purpose of a mitzva, e.g., in order to comfort mourners or to celebrate a wedding, but not for any other reason.<br>The Gemara answers: This teaching is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the mishna merely <b>teaches the usual case.</b> Generally, a group of people would establish an <i>eiruv</i> in order to walk beyond the Shabbat limit only for a special purpose, such as a wedding, but one might be permitted to establish an <i>eiruv</i> even for an optional activity as well. Rav Yosef therefore <b>teaches us</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may indeed be established only for the purpose of a mitzva.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>Anyone who accepted upon himself while it was still day</b> that he will rely upon the <i>eiruv</i> is permitted to rely upon it on Shabbat. The Gemara comments: Apparently, <b>learn from here</b> that <b>there is no</b> halakhic principle of retroactive <b>clarification.</b> That is to say, there is no halakhic assumption that an uncertain state of affairs can be retroactively clarified. A later statement or action cannot retroactively clarify one’s earlier intentions as though he had explicitly stated those intentions at the outset. For <b>if there is</b> a halakhic principle of retroactive <b>clarification,</b> the <i>eiruv</i> should be effective even if one relied upon it only after nightfall, as <b>it is retroactively revealed that he wanted</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>while it was still day.</b><br><b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the mishna <b>teaches:</b> While it was still day. This phrase does not require one to make the decision to rely on the <i>eiruv</i> before Shabbat. Rather, the criterion for using the <i>eiruv</i> on Shabbat is whether <b>they informed him or they did not inform him</b> of the existence of the <i>eiruv</i> prior to Shabbat. In other words, if one knew about the <i>eiruv</i> while it was still day, he may rely on it, even if he decided to use it only after the onset of Shabbat, as the halakhic principle of retroactive clarification is accepted. However, if one was unaware of the existence of the <i>eiruv</i> when it came into effect at the onset of Shabbat, the matter cannot be retroactively clarified.<br><b>Rav Asi said: A six-year-old child may go out by</b> means of <b>his mother’s <i>eiruv</i>.</b> As he is subordinate to her, he is included in her <i>eiruv</i> and does not require his own <i>eiruv</i>. <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A child who needs his mother may go out by</b> means of <b>his mother’s <i>eiruv</i>, but one who does not need his mother may not go out by</b> means of <b>his mother’s <i>eiruv</i>.</b><br><b>And we also learned a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> in a mishna <b>with regard to a <i>sukka</i>: A child who does not need his mother is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i></b> by rabbinical law, so that he will be trained in the observance of mitzvot.<br><b>And we discussed</b> this mishna and raised a question: <b>But who is</b> the <b>child who does not need his mother? The</b> Sages of the <b>school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> This is referring to <b>any</b> child <b>who defecates and his mother does not wipe him.</b> A child who can clean himself is considered sufficiently mature for the purposes of the <i>halakha</i> of <i>sukka</i>.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Any</b> child <b>who wakens</b> from sleep <b>and does not call: Mother,</b> is obligated in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that every child who cries: <b>Mother</b> is considered to be one who needs his mother? Much <b>older</b> children <b>also call</b> out to their mothers for assistance when they awaken. <b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> includes <b>any</b> child <b>who wakens from sleep and does not</b> persistently <b>call: Mother, Mother.</b> A minor who arises only when his mother comes is classified as one who needs his mother.<br>The Gemara continues. The Sages who discussed the mishna asked: <b>And</b> at <b>what</b> age is a child no longer considered to be in need of his mother? Such a child is <b>one about four</b> years <b>old</b> or <b>about five</b> years <b>old,</b> as some children become independent of their mothers earlier than others. This poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Asi, who maintains that even a six-year-old child is considered to be in need of his mother, and may go out by means of his mother’s <i>eiruv</i>.<br><br>Daf 82b<br><br><b>Rav Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said</b> in answer: <b>When Rav Asi said</b> that this child may go out by means of his mother’s <i>eiruv</i>, he was referring to a case <b>where his father established an <i>eiruv</i> on his behalf to the north, and his mother</b> prepared an <i>eiruv</i> on his behalf <b>to the south, as even a six-year-old prefers the company of his mother</b> to that of his father. However, Rav Asi agrees that if they did not both establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him he is not subordinate to his mother.<br><b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A child who needs his mother may go out by</b> means of <b>his mother’s <i>eiruv</i></b> that she established for herself. Until what age may he do so? He can be <b>up to the age of six.</b> This <i>baraita</i> <b>is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehoshua bar Rav Idi,</b> who maintains that a six-year-old may go out by means of his mother’s <i>eiruv</i> only if she established an <i>eiruv</i> on his behalf as well? The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say</b> that this <b>is</b> also <b>a refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi,</b> as here it states: Until the age of six, which indicates that he can be up to, but not including, six years old, whereas Rav Asi maintains that even a six-year-old is included in this <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara states: <b>Rav Asi</b> can <b>say to you</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Up to</b> the age of six, it means <b>up to and including</b> six years old.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say</b> that this <b>is</b> also <b>a refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yannai and Reish Lakish,</b> who maintain that a child in need of his mother is one who is up to age four or five. The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> Rabbi Yannai and Reish Lakish are referring to a situation <b>when</b> the child’s <b>father is in town.</b> As the child can go out with his father, he is no longer in need of his mother, even though he is younger than six. In contrast, <b>there</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>when his father is not in town.</b> The child therefore needs his mother until he reaches the age of six.<br><b>Our Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may establish an <i>eiruv</i> on behalf of his minor son or daughter,</b> and <b>on behalf of his Canaanite servant or maidservant, either with their knowledge or without their knowledge. However, he may not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, neither on behalf of his Hebrew servant or maidservant, nor on behalf of his adult son or daughter, nor on behalf of his wife, except with their knowledge.</b><br><b>It was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may establish an <i>eiruv</i> on behalf of his adult son or daughter, and on behalf of his Hebrew servant or maidservant, and on behalf of his wife, only with their knowledge. However, he may establish an <i>eiruv</i> on behalf of his Canaanite servant or maidservant, and on behalf of his minor son or daughter, either with their knowledge or without their knowledge, as their hand is like his hand,</b> i.e., their status and the domain in which they are located are determined by his status and domain.<br><b>And all of these who established an <i>eiruv</i></b> for themselves, <b>and</b> at the same time <b>their master established an <i>eiruv</i> for them</b> in a different direction, <b>they may go out</b> by means of <b>their master’s</b> <i>eiruv</i>, <b>except for a wife, because she can object</b> by saying that she does not want her husband’s <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara begins its analysis of the <i>baraitot</i> by posing a question: <b>A wife,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> she <b>different</b> from an adult son or daughter? Why can’t they object? They are also of age and under their own authority. <b>Rabba said:</b> The reference is not only to a wife; the <i>tanna</i> is speaking of <b>a wife and all who are similar to her</b> in this regard, such as a Hebrew servant or an adult son.<br><b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: These people may go out by means of their master’s <i>eiruv</i>, <b>except for a wife, because she can object.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason is due to</b> the fact <b>that she objected, but</b> if he established an <i>eiruv</i> and she <b>did not specify</b> her feelings about it one way or another, <b>she may go out by</b> means of <b>her husband’s</b> <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Doesn’t the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>state</b> that he may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>only with their knowledge? What,</b> is this <b>not</b> referring to a case where he asked them whether or not they want this <i>eiruv</i>, and <b>they said yes?</b> It can be inferred from here that if his wife did not say anything, she may not use the <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No; what is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>Only with their knowledge?</b> It means <b>that they were silent</b> and said nothing in protest. This comes <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>where they said no.</b> If, however, they did not object, they may go out by means of the <i>eiruv</i> of the head of the family.<br>The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Wasn’t</b> it taught in that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these who established an <i>eiruv</i></b> for themselves, <b>and their master established an <i>eiruv</i> for them</b> in a different direction, <b>they may go out by</b> means of <b>their master’s</b> <i>eiruv</i>. <b>And that is</b> referring to a situation when they <b>did not specify</b> their feelings, as it does not state that they objected, <b>and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>states: Except for a wife, who may not go out</b> by means of her husband’s <i>eiruv</i>. The <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that even if she did not object, the husband’s <i>eiruv</i> is ineffective for his wife.<br><b>Rava said: Since they established an <i>eiruv</i></b> in a different direction, <b>you have no protest greater than this.</b> They need not register any other objection, as their actions prove that they do not wish to be part of their master’s <i>eiruv</i>.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What is the measure</b> for a joining of Shabbat boundaries? It consists of a quantity of <b>food</b> sufficient for <b>two meals for each and every one</b> of those included in the <i>eiruv</i>. The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to the size of these two meals. It is referring to <b>one’s food</b> that he eats <b>on a weekday and not on Shabbat;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is referring to the amount he eats <b>on Shabbat and not on a weekday. And</b> both <b>this</b> Sage, Rabbi Meir, <b>and that</b> Sage, Rabbi Yehuda, <b>intended to be lenient,</b> as Rabbi Meir maintains that people eat more food on Shabbat, whereas Rabbi Yehuda believes that they consume more on a weekday.<br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says:</b> Food for two meals is the size <b>of a loaf</b> bought <b>with a <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> which is one-forty-eighth of a <i>sela</i>, <b>when four <i>se’a</i></b> of wheat are sold <b>for a <i>sela</i>. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Food for two meals is <b>two</b> of three <b>parts of a loaf, when three</b> loaves are prepared <b>from a <i>kav</i></b> of wheat. In other words, the measure is two-thirds of a loaf the size of one-third of a <i>kav</i>.<br>Having discussed measures with regard to a loaf of bread, the mishna states that <b>half</b> of this loaf is the amount called a half [<i>peras</i>], a measure relevant <b>for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a leprous house.</b> If one enters a house afflicted with leprosy and remains there long enough to eat this amount of food, the clothes he is wearing become ritually impure. <b>And half of its half,</b> a quarter of this loaf, is the amount of ritually impure food that <b>disqualifies the body.</b> In other words, impure food of this amount imparts ritual impurity to the body of the eater, and disqualifies him by rabbinic law from eating <i>teruma</i>.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is <b>food for two meals</b> according to the measures of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Two farmers’</b> [<b><i>ikaryata</i></b>] <b>loaves of bread. Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Two</b> standard <b>loaves of bread</b> baked in the region of <b>the Pappa River.</b><br><b>Rav Yosef said to Rav Yosef, son of Rava: Your father, in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does he hold,</b> that of Rabbi Yehuda or Rabbi Meir? He replied: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Rav Yosef added: <b>I too agree with</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Meir, because if</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda, a difficulty</b> would arise <b>from the popular saying: There is</b> always <b>room for sweets.</b> It is generally accepted that one dining on delicacies eats more, and therefore, the amount of food in Shabbat meals is greater than that of weekdays, as they include more sweet foods.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that one measure is the amount of food for two meals, while Rabbi Shimon established a different amount. A Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And their statements are close to being identical.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this: <b>Are they</b> really <b>identical?</b> According to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> there are <b>four meals to a <i>kav</i>.</b> He maintains that food for two meals is equivalent to a loaf that can be purchased with a <i>pundeyon</i>, which is one-forty-eighth of a <i>sela</i>, when four <i>se’a</i> are bought for a <i>sela</i>. As there are twenty-four <i>kav</i> in four <i>se’a</i>, a loaf purchased with a <i>pundeyon</i> is half of a <i>kav</i>. This means that each meal is a quarter of a <i>kav</i>, or that there are four meals in a <i>kav</i>. In contrast, according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> there are <b>nine meals to a <i>kav</i>.</b> Rabbi Shimon maintains that food for two meals is two-thirds of a loaf equal in size to one-third of a <i>kav</i>. By this calculation, one meal is one-third of a loaf that itself is one-third of a <i>kav</i> in size, which amounts to nine meals in a <i>kav</i>.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> in explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka’s opinion: <b>Deduct one-third for the grocer’s</b> markup, as he takes one-third as profit. This adds one half to the total cost.<br>The Gemara asks: Even after allowing for this adjustment, it <b>remains</b> the case that <b>according to</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, there are <b>nine</b> meals to a <i>kav</i>, <b>whereas according to</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, although it suffices for more than four meals, there are only <b>six</b> meals to a <i>kav</i>. According to the measure of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, each meal is two-thirds of a quarter <i>kav</i>, i.e., one sixth of a <i>kav</i>, which still leaves a considerable discrepancy between their measures.<br><b>Rather,</b> we must explain <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>other</b> statement of <b>Rav Ḥisda, as he said: Deduct one half for the grocer’s</b> markup. If the calculation is based on the assumption that the grocer takes half the sum as profit, the two measures are indeed close.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> it <b>remains</b> the case that <b>according to</b> this <b>Sage,</b> there are <b>nine</b> meals to a <i>kav</i>, whereas <b>according to</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> there are only <b>eight</b> meals to a <i>kav</i>, as each meal is one half of a quarter <i>kav</i>, or one-eighth of a <i>kav</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> the meaning of <b>that which was stated</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And their rulings are close to being identical.</b> Although their measures are not exactly the same, there is no great difference between them.<br>The Gemara comments: Nonetheless, there is <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rav Ḥisda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> concerning the size of the grocer’s profit. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as in <b>this</b> case, <b>the homeowner provides the wood</b> for baking bread, and the grocer therefore marks up the price by one-third as compensation for his efforts. Whereas in <b>that</b> case, <b>the homeowner does not provide the wood;</b> the grocer is entitled to reimbursement for the cost of the wood in addition to the work of baking, and consequently he marks up the price by one half.<br>We learned in the mishna that the time it takes to eat <b>half</b> the loaf is the time it takes <b>for</b> the clothes of one who entered <b>a leprous house</b> to become ritually impure, and <b>half of its half,</b> of the loaf, is the amount of ritually impure food that <b>disqualifies the body</b> from eating <i>teruma</i>.<br><br></body></html>
