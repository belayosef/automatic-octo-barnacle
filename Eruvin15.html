Daf 15a<br><br><b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about <b>a side post that stands by itself,</b> i.e., a side post at the entrance to an alleyway that was not put there for the express purpose of permitting one to carry on Shabbat. <b>Abaye said: It is a</b> valid <b>side post. Rava said: It is not a</b> valid <b>side post.</b><br>The Gemara first narrows the scope of the dispute: In a place <b>where</b> the inhabitants of the alleyway <b>did not rely on it from yesterday,</b> e.g., the alleyway had another side post that fell down on Shabbat, <b>all agree that it is not a</b> valid <b>side post. Where they disagree is</b> in a case <b>where they relied on it from yesterday. Abaye said: It is a</b> valid <b>side post, as they relied on it from yesterday. Rava said: It is not a</b> valid <b>side post; since it was not originally erected for this purpose, it is not</b> considered <b>a</b> valid <b>side post.</b><br>The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>just as they disagree with regard to a side post, they also disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a partition</b> that was not erected to serve that function is considered a valid partition.<br><b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based upon what we learned in the following mishna: With regard to <b>one who makes his <i>sukka</i> among the trees, and the trees serve as its walls, it is</b> a <b>valid</b> <i>sukka</i>. This proves that the trees function as partitions even though they were not erected for this purpose. The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in this mishna? To a case <b>where he planted</b> the trees <b>from the outset for this</b> purpose. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the trees constitute valid walls. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> the Sages <b>should issue a</b> decree to prohibit using a <i>sukka</i> with trees as its walls, due to a concern that <b>perhaps one will come to use the tree</b> on the Festival and detach a branch or leaf in the process, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that no such decree was made and the <i>sukka</i> is permitted.<br>The Gemara tries to present another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>there was a tree there, or a fence, or a barrier of reeds</b> that are interconnected and form a hedge, <b>it is judged</b> to be <b>a</b> valid <b>double post,</b> i.e., it qualifies as a partition suitable to enclose a public well, as will be explained below. This indicates that a partition not constructed to serve as a partition is nonetheless valid.<br>The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here, too, with what are we dealing?</b> With a case <b>where one constructed them from the outset for this</b> purpose. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what does it teach us;</b> is it not obvious that it is a valid double post? The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us</b> that <b>a barrier of reeds</b> is a valid partition if the distance between <b>one reed and the next is less than three handbreadths, as Abaye raised</b> this <b>dilemma to Rabba,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> teaches that it is valid.<br>The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following mishna: With regard to <b>a tree</b> whose branches <b>hang over</b> from a height of greater than ten handbreadths and reach almost to <b>the ground, if</b> the ends of <b>its branches are not higher than three handbreadths from the ground, one may carry under it;</b> the branches constitute partitions all around, and it is therefore permissible to carry in the enclosed area. The Gemara responds: <b>Here, too, with what are we dealing?</b> With a case <b>where he planted</b> the tree <b>from the outset for this</b> purpose.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If so, it should</b> be permitted to <b>carry in all of it</b> no matter how large the area. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>did Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua, say: One may only carry</b> under the tree if its branches enclose an area no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> i.e., five thousand square cubits? If the area is larger, it is not considered a courtyard, and carrying there is prohibited. This indicates that the branches are not considered full-fledged partitions.<br>The Gemara answers: The reason that carrying is permitted only if the enclosed area is less than this size is <b>because it is a dwelling whose use is for</b> the open <b>air</b> beyond it, i.e., it is used by guards who are watching the fields beyond it, rather than as an independent dwelling place, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>any dwelling whose use is for</b> the open <b>air</b> beyond it is that <b>one may carry in it only if</b> its area is no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>.</b><br>The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one</b> who <b>established his Shabbat</b> abode <b>on a mound that was ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and</b> its area was anywhere <b>from four cubits to</b> the <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>; and similarly,</b> one who established his Shabbat abode <b>in a</b> natural <b>cavity</b> of a rock <b>that is ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep and</b> its area was anywhere <b>from four cubits to two <i>beit se’a</i>;</b> and similarly, one who established his Shabbat abode in a field of <b>reaped grain, and</b> rows of <b>stalks</b> ten handbreadths high that have not been reaped <b>surround it,</b> serving as a partition enclosing the reaped area, <b>he may walk in the entire</b> enclosed area, <b>and outside it</b> an additional <b>two thousand cubits.</b> This indicates that a partition not specifically constructed to serve as a partition is nonetheless valid.<br><b>And if you say</b> that <b>here, too,</b> it is a case <b>where he made it from the outset for this</b> purpose, there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> in the case of the <b>grain,</b> this answer is <b>all right; but</b> with regard to <b>a mound and a cavity, what can be said?</b> They were there from time immemorial and were not constructed to serve as partitions.<br><b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects its previous argument and explains: <b>With regard to partitions, all agree that</b> a partition that stands by itself <b>is a partition,</b> despite the fact that it was not erected for that purpose. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>with regard to a side post. Abaye follows his</b> usual line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that <b>a side post</b> serves <b>as a partition, and a partition that stands by itself is a</b> valid <b>partition. And Rava follows his</b> usual line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that <b>a side post</b> serves <b>as a conspicuous marker.</b> Therefore, <b>if it was made with</b> a person’s <b>hands</b> for that purpose, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a conspicuous marker; and if not, it is not</b> considered <b>a conspicuous marker.</b><br>The Gemara now attempts to prove which side is correct according to this version of the dispute. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>stones of a wall that protrude from the wall</b> and are <b>separated from each other</b> by <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>there is no need for another side post</b> in order to permit carrying in the alleyway; the protruding stones join together to form a side post. However, if they are separated by <b>three</b> handbreadths, <b>there is a need for another side post.</b> This indicates that a side post is valid even if it was not erected for that purpose.<br>The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here, too,</b> we are dealing with a case <b>where one built them from the outset for this</b> purpose. The Gemara comments: <b>If so, it is obvious</b> that the side post is valid. The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that it was only <b>in order to connect the building</b> to another building that <b>he built</b> the wall with protruding stones, <b>it teaches us</b> that it is a valid side post. We are not concerned that onlookers might assume that the wall was not originally built as a side post.<br>The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>Tosefta</i> <b>taught by Rabbi Ḥiyya: A wall, one side of which is more recessed than the other, whether</b> the indentation <b>is visible from the outside and</b> the wall looks <b>even from the inside, or</b> it <b>is visible from the inside and</b> the wall looks <b>even from the outside, it is considered a side post.</b> This indicates that a side post is valid even if it was not erected for that purpose.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Here, too,</b> it is a case <b>where one fashioned it from the outset for this</b> purpose, to serve as a side post. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what does it teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that a side post that <b>is visible from the outside and</b> looks <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is considered a side post,</b> although this view is not universally accepted.<br>The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following story: <b>Rav was sitting in a certain alleyway,</b> and <b>Rav Huna was sitting before him. He said to his attendant: Go, bring me a</b> small <b>pitcher of water. By the time he came</b> back with the water, <b>the side post</b> at the entrance to the alleyway <b>had fallen.</b> Rav <b>signaled to him with his hand</b> that he should stop, and the attendant <b>stood in his place. Rav Huna said to</b> Rav: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold</b> that it is permissible <b>to rely on the palm tree</b> located at the entrance to this alleyway as a side post? Rav <b>said: This scholar,</b> Rav Huna, <b>is comparable to one who does not know the teachings</b> of the Sages. <b>Did we rely on</b> the palm tree <b>from yesterday?</b> Since we did not, carrying in the alleyway is not permitted.<br>Based on Rav’s response, the Gemara argues as follows: <b>The reason</b> that the palm tree could not serve as a side post is <b>because we did not rely</b> on the palm tree from yesterday. This indicates that <b>had we relied</b> on it, <b>it would be a</b> valid <b>side post,</b> thus proving that a side post that was not erected for that purpose is nonetheless valid, in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava disagree</b> only in a case <b>where they did not rely on it</b> before Shabbat, but in a case <b>where they did rely on it,</b> all agree <b>it is a</b> valid <b>side post?</b> The Gemara answers: This <b>should not enter your mind, as there was a certain balcony [<i>barka</i>] that was in the house of Bar Ḥavu that Abaye and Rava disagreed about their entire lives.</b> The residents of the alleyway began relying on a pillar upon which the balcony rested as their side post. Since Abaye and Rava disagreed about this case, it is clear that their disagreement applies even when the residents had relied on the item as a side post from before Shabbat.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may construct side posts from anything, even a living creature,</b> provided that it was properly attached to the entrance of the alleyway, <b>and Rabbi Meir prohibits</b> using a living creature as a side post. The mishna continues with a similar dispute: Even a living creature <b>imparts ritual impurity</b> if it used as the <b>covering of a grave.</b><br><br>Daf 15b<br><br><b>But Rabbi Meir deems it pure.</b> Likewise, <b>one may write women’s bills of divorce on</b> anything, even a living creature. <b>But Rabbi Yosei HaGelili invalidates</b> a bill of divorce written on a living creature.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: An animate object may neither be used as a wall for a <i>sukka</i>, nor as a side post for an alleyway, nor as</b> one of the upright <b>boards</b> surrounding <b>a well, nor as the covering of a grave. They said in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: Nor may one write women’s bills of divorce on it.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s</b> opinion? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her; that he write her <b>a scroll</b> of severance and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1): From the word scroll, <b>I have</b> derived that <b>only a scroll</b> is valid. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include all objects</b> as valid materials upon which a bill of divorce may be written? <b>The Torah states: “That he write her,” in any case,</b> i.e., any surface upon which the formula can be written. <b>If so, why does the verse state “scroll”? To tell you</b> that a bill of divorce must be written on a surface like a scroll: <b>Just as a scroll is neither alive nor food, so too,</b> a bill of divorce may be written on <b>any object that is neither alive nor food.</b> That is why Rabbi Yosei HaGelili invalidates a bill of divorce written on a living being.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree and say that a bill of divorce may be written even on a living creature or on food, interpret the verse? They contend: <b>Is</b> the verse <b>written:</b> “Let him write for her <b>in the scroll [<i>basefer</i>],”</b> indicating the only type of surface on which the bill of divorce may be written? No, <b>scroll [<i>sefer</i>] is written, which comes to</b> teach that <b>a mere account of the matters [<i>sefirot devarim</i>]</b> is required. In other words, <i>sefer</i> is referring not to the surface on which a bill of divorce must be written, but rather to the essence of the bill of divorce. The verse teaches that the bill of divorce must contain particular content.<br>The Gemara continues: <b>And what do the Rabbis derive</b> from <b>the</b> phrase <b>“that he write her”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase <b>is required</b> to teach the principle that a woman <b>is divorced</b> only <b>by means of writing,</b> i.e., a bill of divorce, <b>and she is not divorced by means of money. It might have entered your mind to say: Since</b> in the verse, <b>leaving</b> marriage, i.e., divorce, <b>is juxtaposed to becoming</b> married, i.e., betrothal, then, <b>just as becoming</b> married <b>is</b> effected <b>with money, so</b> too, <b>leaving</b> marriage may be effected <b>with money.</b> Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us:</b> “That he write for her”; divorce can be effected only with a written bill of divorce.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, from where does he</b> derive <b>this reasoning,</b> that a woman cannot be divorced with money? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase: <b>A scroll of severance,</b> which teaches that <b>a scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him.<br>The Gemara continues: <b>And the Rabbis</b> explain that <b>this</b> phrase: <b>A scroll of severance, is required</b> to teach that a bill of divorce must be <b>a matter that severs</b> all connection <b>between him and her. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a man says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce, on condition that you will</b> never <b>drink wine,</b> or <b>on condition that you will never go to your father’s house, that is not severance;</b> the bill of divorce is not valid. If a bill of divorce imposes a condition upon the woman that permanently binds her to her husband, her relationship with her husband has not been completely severed, which is a prerequisite for divorce. If, however, he imposes a condition <b>for the duration of thirty days,</b> or any other limited period of time, <b>that is severance,</b> and the bill of divorce is valid, as the relationship will be completely terminated at the end of the thirty-day period.<br><b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili derives</b> that a condition without a termination point invalidates the divorce <b>from</b> the fact that instead of using the term <b><i>karet</i>,</b> the verse uses the more expanded term <b><i>keritut</i>.</b> Inasmuch as both terms denote severance, using the longer term teaches us two things: Divorce can be effected only by means of writing and not through money, and divorce requires total severance.<br><b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, they do not derive</b> anything from the expansion of <b><i>karet</i></b> to <b><i>keritut</i>.</b><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a caravan camped in a valley,</b> i.e., an open space not enclosed by walls, <b>and</b> the travelers <b>enclosed</b> their camp <b>with</b> partitions made of the <b>animals’ equipment,</b> e.g., saddles and the like, <b>one may carry inside</b> the enclosed area, <b>provided that</b> the resultant partition <b>will be a fence ten handbreadths high, and</b> that <b>there will not be breaches</b> in the partition <b>greater</b> than <b>the built</b> segment.<br><b>Any breach that is approximately ten cubits</b> wide <b>is permitted</b> and does not invalidate the partition <b>because it is</b> considered <b>like an entrance.</b> However, if one of the breaches is <b>greater than</b> ten cubits, <b>it is prohibited</b> to carry anywhere in the enclosed area.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree about the case where the <b>breached</b> segment of the partition <b>equals the standing</b> portion. <b>Rav Pappa said: It is permitted</b> to carry within that enclosure. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: It is prohibited.</b><br>The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Pappa said: It is permitted. This is what the Merciful One taught Moses: Do not breach the majority</b> of the partition; as long as the greater part is not breached, it is considered a partition. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: It is prohibited. This is what the Merciful One taught Moses: Circumscribe the greater</b> part; if the greater part is not enclosed, it is not a partition.<br><b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And there will not be breaches</b> in the partition <b>greater</b> than <b>the built</b> segment. Only then would carrying be permitted in the enclosed area. By inference, <b>if</b> the breaches <b>equal the built</b> segment, <b>it is permitted.</b> This presents a difficulty for Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.<br>The Gemara responds: <b>Do not say:</b> By inference if they <b>equal the built</b> segment, <b>it is permitted; rather, say: If the built</b> segment <b>is greater than the breach, it is permitted</b> to carry in the enclosed area.<br>The Gemara continues: <b>However,</b> according to that way of understanding the mishna, if the breach <b>equals the built</b> segment, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is carrying <b>prohibited? If so, let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that carrying is permitted, provided that the <b>breaches do not equal the built</b> segment. It can be inferred from this that if the breaches are greater than the built segment, it is certainly prohibited. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this poses <b>a difficulty</b> to the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.<br>The Gemara cites a proof to support Rav Pappa’s opinion. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which the mishna taught about the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>: With regard to <b>one who roofed his <i>sukka</i> with</b> metal <b>skewers or with bed posts,</b> both of which are unfit for <i>sukka</i> roofing because they are susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>if there is space between them, equal to their</b> width, filled with materials valid for <i>sukka</i> roofing, the <i>sukka</i> <b>is valid.</b> Apparently, with regard to roofing, if the valid materials equal the invalid, the <i>sukka</i> is valid. Similarly, if the built segment of an enclosure equals the breached segment, it is a valid enclosure for the purpose of carrying on Shabbat. This supports Rav Pappa’s opinion against that of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.<br>The Gemara contests this conclusion. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is with a case <b>where</b> the skewers can be <b>inserted and extracted</b> easily. In other words, the case of the mishna in <i>Sukka</i> is not one where there are equal amounts of valid and invalid roofing. It is referring to a case where there is additional space between the skewers, which allows for their easy insertion and removal. Consequently, the space filled by the valid roofing is greater than that filled by the skewers.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it possible to be precise?</b> Couldn’t the mishna in <i>Sukka</i> be understood as describing a case where the gaps between the skewers equal the width of the skewers? That understanding supports the opinion of Rav Pappa, who maintains that when the valid segment precisely equals the invalid segment, the whole is valid.<br><b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> This mishna is referring to a case <b>where one adds</b> roofing, so that the area of the valid roofing is greater than that of the skewers.<br><b>Rava said:</b> This is referring to a case where <b>if</b> the skewers <b>were placed crosswise</b> to the <i>sukka</i>, <b>he should place</b> the valid roofing <b>lengthwise,</b> and similarly, if the skewers were placed <b>lengthwise, he should place</b> the valid roofing <b>crosswise,</b> ensuring that there is more valid than invalid roofing.<br>The Gemara seeks to adduce a proof in support of the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a caravan camped in a field, and</b> the travelers <b>surrounded</b> their camp <b>with camels</b> that were made to crouch down, or <b>with</b> their <b>saddles,</b><br><br></body></html>
