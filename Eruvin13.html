Daf 13a<br><br>The mishna relates that a student recited a <i>halakha</i> before Rabbi Akiva, and he did not accept the student’s version of the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, as <b>Rabbi Akiva said: They disagree about this,</b> an alleyway less than four cubits wide, <b>and about that,</b> an alleyway more than four cubits wide.<br>The Gemara asks: In that case, the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> is identical with the opinion <b>first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna, as he too holds that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree in all cases, irrespective of the width of the alleyway. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Rav Aḥlai, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yeḥiel,</b> that an alleyway less than four handbreadths wide requires no corrective action. However, their respective opinions <b>are not defined;</b> which <i>tanna</i> accepts the view of Rav Aḥlai and which <i>tanna</i> rejects it cannot be determined.<br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said: Rabbi Yishmael did not state this matter,</b> as it is unlikely that Rabbi Yishmael would err in this manner; <b>rather,</b> it was <b>that disciple who stated that matter</b> on his own, <b>and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that disciple.</b><br>With regard to that <i>baraita</i> the Gemara asks: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself is difficult. You stated</b> initially that <b>Rabbi Yishmael did not state this matter; apparently the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of the disciple. <b>And then you said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that disciple.</b><br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Rabbi Akiva said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with that disciple <b>only to sharpen</b> the minds of <b>his students with</b> his statement. Seeking to encourage his students to suggest novel opinions, he praised that disciple before them but did not actually rule in accordance with the disciple’s opinion.<br><b>And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said,</b> in another attempt to resolve the contradiction: The statement of the disciple <b>appears</b> to be reasonable <b>was stated.</b> Although Rabbi Yishmael himself did not make that statement, the statement of the disciple is reasonable.<br><b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Anywhere that you find</b> a statement introduced with: <b>A certain disciple said before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, it is none other than Rabbi Meir,</b> who was the student <b>who served</b> both <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva.</b><br><b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: When I was</b> a student <b>with Rabbi Yishmael, I used to put iron sulfate [<i>kankantom</i>] into the ink</b> with which I wrote Torah scrolls, <b>and he did not say anything to me. When I came</b> to study <b>with Rabbi Akiva, he prohibited me</b> from doing <b>so.</b><br>The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Meir: When I studied with Rabbi Akiva</b> as his disciple, <b>I used to put iron sulfate into the ink, and he did not say anything to me. But when I came</b> to study <b>with Rabbi Yishmael, he said to me: My son, what is your vocation? I replied: I am a scribe [<i>lavlar</i>]</b> who writes Torah scrolls. <b>He said to me: My son, be careful in your vocation, as your vocation is heavenly service,</b> and care must be taken <b>lest you omit a single letter or add a single letter</b> out of place, <b>and you will end up destroying the whole world in its entirety.</b> Addition or omission of a single letter can change the meaning from truth [<i>emet</i>] to death [<i>met</i>].<br><b>I said to him: I have one substance called iron sulfate, which I place into the ink,</b> and therefore I am not concerned. <b>He said to me: May one place iron sulfate into the ink? Didn’t the Torah state</b> with regard to <i>sota</i>: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall write</b> these curses in a book, <b>and he shall blot them out</b> into the water of bitterness” (Numbers 5:23)? The Torah requires <b>writing that can be blotted out.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies elements of the conversation: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saying to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>and what is he answering him?</b> Rabbi Meir’s response with regard to iron sulfate does not seem to address Rabbi Yishmael’s comments with regard to omissions and additions.<br>The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Meir <b>is saying to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: <b>There is no need</b> to mention <b>defective and plene</b> words, <b>as I am an expert; however, even with regard to the concern that a fly might come and land on the crown of</b> the letter <b><i>dalet</i> and blot it out and render it a <i>reish</i>,</b> thereby changing the meaning of the word, I am not concerned, as <b>I have a substance called iron sulfate that I place into the ink</b> so that it will not be erased.<br>Nevertheless, <b>there is a difficulty between service and service,</b> as one source states that Rabbi Meir initially served Rabbi Akiva, whereas the other source states that he served Rabbi Yishmael first. <b>There is a difficulty between</b> the words <b>he prohibited it</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, which is referring to Rabbi Akiva, <b>and he prohibited it</b> in the statement of Rav Yehuda, which is referring to Rabbi Yishmael.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, there is no difficulty between</b> the accounts in the two sources with regard to <b>service and service,</b> as it can be suggested as follows: Rabbi Meir <b>initially came</b> to study <b>before Rabbi Akiva, and since he was unable to comprehend</b> the teachings <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>he came before Rabbi Yishmael and studied the tradition, and again came before Rabbi Akiva and studied logical</b> analysis. After studying the basic principles from Rabbi Yishmael, he was able to understand the more complex teachings of Rabbi Akiva.<br>Having reconciled the first difficulty, the Gemara continues: <b>However, the difficulty with regard to</b> whether Rabbi Akiva <b>prohibited</b> iron sulfate or Rabbi Yishmael <b>prohibited</b> it remains <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara notes: It indeed remains <b>difficult;</b> no answer was found.<br>The Gemara continues the discussion of iron sulfate. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: One may place iron sulfate into the ink</b> that is to be used <b>for all</b> sacred writings, <b>except for</b> the writing of <b>the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> as it must be possible to erase that writing. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says in his name: Except for</b> the writing of <b>the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i></b> used <b>in the Temple</b> in the ordeal to determine the guilt or innocence of the wife suspected of adultery.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between their</b> opinions, i.e., what is their point of dispute? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yirmeya said:</b> The difference <b>between their</b> opinions <b>is</b> whether it is permissible <b>to erase</b> the passage of a <i>sota</i> <b>from a Torah</b> scroll. The <i>tanna’im</i> of the <i>baraita</i> disagree whether or not a section taken from a Torah scroll may be used for this purpose, or whether a special scroll must be written for use in the ordeal of the <i>sota</i>.<br><b>And those <i>tanna’im</i></b> disagree in the same dispute <b>as these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A scroll that was written for one woman suspected of infidelity but was not used, <b>her scroll is not fit</b> to prepare the water <b>to give to another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya said: Her scroll is fit</b> to be used to prepare the water <b>to give another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> The legal status of a Torah scroll, which is not written for a particular <i>sota</i>, should be the same.<br><b>Rav Pappa said: Perhaps that is not</b> the case, as the two circumstances are not comparable. <b>The first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>stated</b> his opinion that one woman’s scroll may not be used for another woman <b>only there; since it had</b> originally <b>been designated in the name of</b> one woman, e.g., <b>Rachel, it cannot then be designated in the name of</b> another woman, e.g., <b>Leah. However, in the case of a Torah</b> scroll, <b>which is written with no particular</b> person in mind, he <b>too</b> may say that <b>we</b> may <b>erase</b> it to be used for another woman, and it is not disqualified because it was not written in her name.<br>Furthermore, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> in another attempt to resolve the matter: <b>Perhaps it is not so,</b> as an additional distinction exists between the two cases: <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya stated</b> his opinion that the first woman’s scroll may be used for another woman <b>only there because at least,</b> in that case, <b>it was written for a</b> particular <b><i>sota</i> in the world. However, in the case of a Torah</b> scroll, <b>which was written for study,</b> he <b>too</b> would agree that <b>we do not erase</b> it.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If one wrote a bill of divorce to divorce his wife,</b><br><br>Daf 13b<br><br><b>but</b> later <b>reconsidered</b> and did not divorce her, <b>and a resident of his city found him and said: Your name is</b> the same <b>as my name, and your wife’s name is</b> the same <b>as my wife’s name,</b> and we reside in the same town; give me the bill of divorce, and I will use it to divorce my wife, then this document <b>is invalid to divorce with it?</b> Apparently, a man may not divorce his wife with a bill of divorce written for another woman, and the same should apply to the scroll of a <i>sota</i>.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>How can you compare</b> the two cases? <b>There,</b> with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>it is written: “And he shall write for her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), and therefore <b>we require writing</b> it <b>in her name,</b> specifically for her; whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, <b>it is written: “And he shall perform with her</b> all this ritual” (Numbers 5:30), and therefore <b>we require performance in her name.</b> In <b>her</b> case, the <b>performance is erasure;</b> however, writing of the scroll need not be performed specifically for her.<br>On the topic of Rabbi Meir and his Torah study, the Gemara cites an additional statement. <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that in the generation of Rabbi Meir there was no</b> one of the Sages who is <b>his equal. Why</b> then <b>didn’t</b> the Sages <b>establish the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his</b> opinion? It is <b>because his colleagues were unable to ascertain the profundity of his opinion.</b> He was so brilliant that he could present a cogent argument for any position, even if it was not consistent with the prevalent <i>halakha</i>. <b>As he</b> would <b>state with regard to</b> a ritually <b>impure</b> item that it is <b>pure, and display justification</b> for that ruling, and likewise he would state <b>with regard to</b> a ritually <b>pure</b> item that it is <b>impure, and display justification</b> for that ruling. The Sages were unable to distinguish between the statements that were <i>halakha</i> and those that were not.<br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir was not his name; rather, Rabbi Nehorai was his name. And why was he called</b> by the <b>name Rabbi Meir?</b> It was <b>because he illuminates [<i>meir</i>] the eyes of the Sages in</b> matters of <b>the <i>halakha</i>. And Rabbi Nehorai was not the name</b> of the <i>tanna</i> known by that name; <b>rather, Rabbi Neḥemya was his name, and some say: Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh was his name. And why was he called</b> by the <b>name Rabbi Nehorai?</b> It is <b>because he enlightens [<i>manhir</i>] the eyes of the Sages in</b> matters of <b>the <i>halakha</i>.</b><br>The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> The fact <b>that I am</b> more <b>incisive than my colleagues is</b> due to the fact <b>that I saw Rabbi Meir from behind,</b> i.e., I sat behind him when I was his student. <b>Had I seen him from the front, I would be</b> even more <b>incisive, as it is written: “And your eyes shall see your teacher”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). Seeing the face of one’s teacher increases one’s understanding and sharpens one’s mind.<br>And the Gemara stated that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Meir had a disciple, and his name was Sumakhus, who would state with regard to each and every matter of ritual impurity forty-eight reasons</b> in support of the ruling of <b>impurity, and with regard to each and every matter of ritual purity forty-eight reasons</b> in support of the ruling of <b>purity.</b><br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was a distinguished disciple at Yavne who could</b> with his incisive intellect <b>purify the creeping animal,</b> explicitly deemed ritually impure by the Torah, adducing <b>one hundred and fifty reasons</b> in support of his argument.<br><b>Ravina said: I</b> too <b>will deliberate and purify it</b> employing the following reasoning: <b>And just as a snake that kills</b> people and animals <b>and</b> thereby <b>increases ritual impurity</b> in the world, as a corpse imparts impurity through contact, through being carried, and by means of a tent, <b>is ritually pure</b> and transmits no impurity, <b>a creeping animal that does not kill and</b> does not <b>increase impurity</b> in the world, <b>all the more so</b> should it be pure.<br>The Gemara rejects this: <b>And it is not so;</b> that is not a valid <i>a fortiori</i> argument, as it can be refuted. A snake <b>is performing a mere act of a thorn.</b> A thorn causes injury and even death; nevertheless, it is not ritually impure. The same applies to a snake, and therefore this <i>a fortiori</i> argument is rejected.<br><b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: For three years Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed. These said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with our</b> opinion, <b>and these said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with our</b> opinion. Ultimately, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and proclaimed:</b> Both <b>these and those are the words of the living God. However, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Since both these and those are the words of the living God, why were Beit Hillel privileged to</b> have <b>the <i>halakha</i> established in accordance with their</b> opinion? The reason is <b>that they were agreeable and forbearing,</b> showing restraint when affronted, and when they taught the <i>halakha</i> they would <b>teach</b> both <b>their</b> own <b>statements and the statements of Beit Shammai. Moreover,</b> when they formulated their teachings and cited a dispute, <b>they prioritized the statements of Beit Shammai to their</b> own <b>statements,</b> in deference to Beit Shammai.<br><b>As</b> in the mishna <b>that we learned:</b> In the case of <b>one whose head and most of his body were in the <i>sukka</i>, but his table was in the house, Beit Shammai deem</b> this <i>sukka</i> <b>invalid; and Beit Hillel deem it valid. Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: Wasn’t there an incident in which the Elders of Beit Shammai and the Elders of Beit Hillel went to visit Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit, and they found him sitting</b> with <b>his head and most of his body in the <i>sukka</i>, but his table was in the house? Beit Shammai said to them: From there</b> do you seek to adduce <b>a proof?</b> Those visitors, <b>too, said to him: If that was</b> the manner in which <b>you were accustomed</b> to perform the mitzva, <b>you have never fulfilled the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in</b> all <b>your days.</b> It is apparent from the phrasing of the mishna that when the Sages of Beit Hillel related that the Elders of Beit Shammai and the Elders of Beit Hillel visited Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit, they mentioned the Elders of Beit Shammai before their own Elders.<br>This is <b>to teach you that anyone who humbles himself, the Holy One, Blessed be He, exalts him, and anyone who exalts himself, the Holy One, Blessed be He, humbles him. Anyone who seeks greatness, greatness flees from him, and,</b> conversely, <b>anyone who flees from greatness, greatness seeks him. And anyone who</b> attempts to <b>force the moment</b> and expends great effort to achieve an objective precisely when he desires to do so, <b>the moment forces him</b> too, and he is unsuccessful. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>anyone who</b> is patient and <b>yields to the moment, the moment stands</b> by <b>his</b> side, and he will ultimately be successful.<br><b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>For two and a half years, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed. These say: It would have been preferable had man not been created than to have been created. And those said: It is preferable for man to have been created than had he not been created.</b> Ultimately, <b>they were counted and concluded: It would have been preferable had man not been created than to have been created.</b> However, <b>now that he has been created, he should examine his actions</b> that he has performed and seek to correct them. <b>And some say: He should scrutinize his</b> planned <b>actions</b> and evaluate whether or not and in what manner those actions should be performed, so that he will not sin.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The</b> cross <b>beam, which</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> may be used to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, must be <b>wide enough to receive</b> and hold <b>a small brick. And</b> this <b>small brick</b> is <b>half a large brick,</b> which measures <b>three handbreadths,</b> i.e., a handbreadth and a half. <b>It is sufficient that the</b> cross <b>beam will be a handbreadth in width,</b> not a handbreadth and a half, <b>enough to hold a small brick across its width.</b><br>And the cross beam must be <b>wide enough to hold a small brick</b> and also <b>sturdy enough to hold a small brick</b> and not collapse. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it is <b>wide</b> enough to hold the brick, <b>even though it is not sturdy</b> enough to actually support it, it is sufficient. Therefore, even if the cross beam <b>is</b> made <b>of straw or reeds, one considers it as though it were</b> made <b>of metal.</b><br>If the cross beam is <b>curved,</b> so that a small brick cannot rest on it, <b>one considers it as though it were straight;</b> if it is <b>round, one considers it as though it were square.</b> The following principle was stated with regard to a round cross beam: <b>Any</b> beam <b>with a circumference of three handbreadths is a handbreadth in width,</b> i.e., in diameter.<br><br></body></html>
