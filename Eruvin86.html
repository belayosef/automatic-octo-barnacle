Daf 86a<br><br><b>Make way</b> even more <b>for one</b> who possesses <b>two hundred <i>maneh</i>. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said before him: My teacher,</b> Bonyas, <b>father of this</b> one, <b>has a thousand ships out at sea and, corresponding to them, a thousand towns on land.</b> He should be granted pride of place due to his exorbitant wealth. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: When you reach</b> his <b>father, tell him: Do not send him to me in these garments.</b> Dress him in accordance with his wealth and status, so that he will be honored accordingly.<br>In explanation of this story, the Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>honor the wealthy,</b> and <b>Rabbi Akiva would</b> likewise <b>honor the wealthy, in accordance with Rava bar Mari’s interpretation</b> of the verse: <b>“May he be enthroned before God forever; appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him”</b> (Psalms 61:8). <b>When may he be enthroned before God forever? When he appoints</b> [<b><i>man</i></b>] <b>mercy and truth that they may preserve him.</b> Rava bar Mari explains the word <i>man</i> as referring to portions of food and interprets the verse as follows: If one provides food to others, he deserves to be enthroned before God, to be shown honor and respect. Consequently, it is proper to honor the wealthy who bestow such kindnesses.<br><b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said:</b> What is considered a right of usage? <b>For example,</b> if the homeowner stores <b>the pin of a plough</b> in his tenant’s quarters. The tenant is prohibited to remove this pin from his residence on Shabbat due to its being set aside from use [<i>muktze</i>], and the homeowner therefore enjoys a fixed right of usage there.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> A Sage <b>of the school of Shmuel taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If the homeowner stores <b>an object that can be moved on Shabbat</b> with his tenant, the tenant’s residence <b>renders</b> the other residence <b>prohibited</b> if he neglected to join the <i>eiruv</i>. This is not considered a right of usage. If the <b>object</b> being stored is one <b>that cannot be moved on Shabbat,</b> the tenant’s residence <b>does not render it prohibited for</b> them to use the courtyard.<br>The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if the tenant <b>has untithed produce</b> that may not be moved on Shabbat; or if <b>he has lumps</b> of glass or iron; <b>or anything</b> else <b>that may not be moved on Shabbat</b> that the homeowner deposited with him, the tenant <b>does not render it prohibited for</b> the other residents to use the courtyard.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who leaves his house,</b> which is located in a shared courtyard, <b>and goes to spend Shabbat in a different town, whether</b> he is <b>a gentile or a Jew, he renders it prohibited</b> for the other residents to use the courtyard as though he were still at home; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: He does not render it prohibited for</b> them, as he left behind him an empty residence.<br><b>Rabbi Yosei says: A gentile renders it prohibited</b> but <b>a Jew does not render it prohibited,</b> as <b>it is not the manner of a Jew to come</b> home <b>on Shabbat.</b> A Jew will not return home, therefore his empty residence does not render it prohibited. By contrast, a gentile might return over the course of Shabbat. Therefore, he is not considered to have fully uprooted himself from his house, and he renders it prohibited.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if the Jew <b>left his house and went to spend Shabbat with his daughter</b> who lived <b>in the same town, he does not render it prohibited.</b> Although he can return home at any time, it is assumed <b>that he has already removed from his mind</b> any thought of going back there and has established his Shabbat residence away from his home.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> if one went to <b>his daughter’s</b> house; <b>but</b> if he went to <b>his son’s</b> house, <b>no,</b> this is not the <i>halakha</i>. One cannot be sure that he will be able to stay at his son’s house, for his daughter-in-law might object to his presence and force him to return home. <b>As people say: If a dog barks at you, enter; if a female dog barks at you, leave.</b> In other words, the objections of a female, such as one’s daughter-in-law, who will certainly not be opposed by her husband, are more powerful than those of a male, such as one’s son-in-law.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a cistern that is</b> located <b>between two courtyards,</b> situated partly in each courtyard, <b>one may not draw</b> water <b>from it on Shabbat,</b> lest the residents of one courtyard draw water from the domain of the other courtyard, <b>unless a partition ten handbreadths high was erected for it</b> as a separation between the domains. This partition is effective <b>whether</b> it is <b>below,</b> in the water, <b>or whether it is within the</b> airspace of the cistern below the <b>rim,</b> above the surface of the water.<br><b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b> This is the subject of an early dispute of <i>tanna’im</i>, as <b>Beit Shammai said</b> that the partition, which permits drawing water, must be placed <b>below; and Beit Hillel said</b> it should be positioned <b>above. Rabbi Yehuda said: A partition is no better than the wall between them.</b> A wall dividing the two courtyards passes over the cistern, therefore it is not necessary to erect an additional partition in the cistern’s airspace.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna said:</b> When Beit Shammai said <b>below,</b> they meant <b>actually below,</b> near the water; the partition need not touch the water itself. When Beit Hillel said <b>above,</b> they meant <b>actually above,</b> higher than the water and near the rim of the cistern. <b>And both of these</b> are within the airspace of the <b>cistern. And Rav Yehuda said: Below</b> means <b>below the water,</b> so that part of the partition is inside the water; whereas <b>above</b> means <b>above the water,</b> in such a manner that the partition does not come into contact with the water.<br><b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye:</b> With regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda said: Below</b> means <b>below the water, what is different</b> about a case where the partition is <b>actually below,</b> in the airspace cistern near the water, that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <b>not</b> draw water in that case? It is <b>because</b> he was concerned lest <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> beneath the partition. In a case where the partition is located <b>below the water,</b> near the bottom of the cistern, <b>as well, won’t the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> above it?<br>Abaye <b>said to him: Didn’t you hear that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some arrived at</b> this statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The tops of the reeds</b> of the partition <b>must be visible a handbreadth above</b> the surface of <b>the water?</b> This will ensure that there is a full partition between the two sides of the cistern.<br><b>And</b> Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan <b>further</b> asked: With regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda said: Above</b> means <b>above the water,</b> we can inquire: <b>What is different</b> about a case where the partition is <b>actually above,</b> i.e., near the rim of the cistern that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <b>not</b> draw water in that case? It is <b>because</b> he was concerned lest <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> beneath the partition. However, even if the partition is <b>above the water</b> below the rim of the cistern, <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards will <b>also become intermingled</b> beneath it. Abaye <b>said to him: Haven’t you heard that which Ya’akov from Karḥina taught: The ends of the reeds</b> of a partition <b>must be immersed</b> at least <b>a handbreadth</b> into the <b>water,</b> so that they divide the water in the cistern?<br><b>But</b> the Gemara raises a further question. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If there is a cross <b>beam of four</b> handbreadths, it <b>permits</b> one to carry underneath it <b>in a ruin.</b> If a crossbeam four handbreadths wide is laid across the walls of a ruin, its edges are viewed as though they descended to the ground on each side, thereby forming partitions that permit one to carry under the cross beam. <b>And Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b><br><br>Daf 86b<br><br>A cross <b>beam of four</b> handbreadths laid across a cistern located between two courtyards <b>permits</b> one to draw <b>water</b> from that cistern.<br>With this in mind, the following difficulty arises: The <b>bucket</b> he uses to draw the water <b>might drift</b> under the cross <b>beam to the other side</b> of the cistern <b>and bring</b> water from the other courtyard. The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages have established that a bucket does not drift more than four handbreadths</b> from the point where it was lowered, and it will therefore stay on its original side of the partition.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Nonetheless, the water becomes intermingled under the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> and consequently the bucket will bring up water from the other courtyard. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the reason for the leniency is not that the cross beam actually prevents the flow of the water, but <b>because the Sages were lenient with regard to water.</b> They allowed a partition suspended above the water to be considered as though it blocked the flow of the water. <b>As Rav Tavla asked of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>a suspended partition, does it permit</b> carrying <b>in a ruin?</b> Do we say that the remnants of the walls suspended in the air are considered as though they descended to the ground and closed off the area, thereby rendering it a private domain? Rav <b>said to him: A suspended partition</b> of this kind <b>permits</b> carrying <b>only</b> in the case <b>of water,</b> as <b>the Sages were lenient with regard to water.</b><br>The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There is no need for a partition in the cistern, as <b>a partition</b> inside a cistern <b>is no</b> better than the wall above it. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Yehuda stated this in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who said: A suspended partition permits</b> carrying <b>even on land,</b> as it is considered as though it descended to the ground and sealed off the area. Accordingly, there is no need to erect a partition inside the airspace of a cistern.<br><b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who lowers</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>walls from above</b> going <b>downward, when</b> the walls <b>are three handbreadths higher than the ground,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is invalid,</b> as they are not considered partitions; but if he constructed walls <b>from below</b> going <b>upward, if they are ten handbreadths high</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is valid,</b> even if they do not reach the roofing.<br><b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> however, <b>says: Just as</b> with regard to walls constructed <b>from below</b> going <b>upward, ten</b> handbreadths suffice, <b>so</b> too, in the case of walls built <b>from above</b> going <b>downward, ten</b> handbreadths are enough for it to be considered a whole wall, even if it more than three handbreadths above the ground. Similarly, Rabbi Yehuda maintains that a partition suspended above a cistern is considered as though it descended and sealed off the area.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>But this is not so,</b> for we can distinguish between the two opinions and claim that <b>neither Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yosei, nor does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br>The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not</b> necessarily <b>hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yosei,</b> as a distinction can be made between the two cases. <b>Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to the joining of courtyards,</b> which are required <b>by rabbinic law, but</b> in the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which</b> is required <b>by Torah law, no,</b> he did not say that we can rely on suspended partitions.<br><b>And</b> conversely, <b>Rabbi Yosei does not</b> necessarily <b>hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yosei stated</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to a <i>sukka</i>,</b> which <b>is a prohibition</b> stated in the Torah <b>from a positive commandment.</b> The prohibition is not written as a negative commandment, but it can be inferred from a positive commandment. Neglect of the positive commandment of <i>sukka</i> is not punishable by the court, therefore we are not stringent in this regard. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> which is <b>a prohibition</b> punishable <b>by stoning,</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>did not state</b> his opinion. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei might agree that we must be very stringent with regard to all <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, even those that are rabbinic in origin.<br><b>And if you ask: That incident, which occurred in Tzippori,</b> when they relied on suspended partitions on land for Shabbat, <b>on whose authority was it performed?</b> It was done <b>not on the authority of Rabbi Yosei, but</b> rather <b>it was performed on the authority of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who maintains that a suspended partition renders it permitted to carry even if it is over land and even on Shabbat.<br>The incident transpired in the following manner. <b>As when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> It <b>once</b> happened that the people <b>forgot and did not bring a Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue on Friday <b>while it was still day,</b> which meant they were left without a scroll from which to read on Shabbat. <b>On the following day,</b> Shabbat, <b>they spread a sheet over the pillars</b> positioned between the house where the scroll was kept and the synagogue, thereby forming a corridor with partitions suspended on each side. <b>And</b> in this manner <b>they brought the Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue <b>and read from it.</b><br>The Gemara expresses surprise at the wording of this account: Did they actually <b>spread</b> sheets on Shabbat? <b>Is it permitted</b> to do so <b><i>ab initio</i>? But doesn’t everyone agree that one may not erect a temporary tent on Shabbat</b> <i>ab initio</i>? Spreading sheets over pillars is considered constructing a temporary tent.<br><b>Rather,</b> what happened was that <b>they found sheets spread over the pillars,</b> which they used as partitions, <b>and</b> in this manner <b>they brought the Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue <b>and read from it.</b><br><b>Rabba said: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya said the same thing.</b> Both were very lenient with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of a partition over water. The ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda is that which we</b> just <b>said,</b> that the wall of the courtyard permits a cistern. The ruling of <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya is as we learned: Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya says:</b> In the case of <b>a balcony that contains four cubits by four cubits,</b> which is suspended over water,<br><br></body></html>
