Daf 51a<br><br><b>Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>only</b> in a case <b>where, were he to run to the trunk</b> of the tree <b>he could reach it</b> before the onset of Shabbat. <b>Abaye said to him: But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>state: And it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling, indicating that he is farther away than that?<br>The Gemara answers: The mishna means that <b>it grew dark</b> while he was traveling so that he can no longer return <b>to his house</b> before nightfall; <b>however, he is able</b> to <b>go to the trunk</b> of the tree before Shabbat. <b>Some state</b> a different version of the previous statement. <b>Rava said:</b> The mishna means that <b>it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling, so that <b>were he to walk very slowly</b> he could not reach his house; <b>however, if he runs, he can</b> still <b>arrive</b> before Shabbat.<br><b>Rabba and Rav Yosef were going</b> together <b>along the way. Rabba said to Rav Yosef: Our residence will be beneath the palm that carries its brother,</b> the one with another palm tree leaning on it. <b>And some say</b> he said to him: Our residence will be <b>beneath the palm that spared its owner from the land tax [<i>karga</i>],</b> the palm which yielded enough dates for its owner to pay his entire land tax.<br>Rabba asked: <b>Does the Master know</b> of that tree? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> No, <b>I do not know</b> of it. <b>He said to him:</b> Then <b>rely on me, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If two</b> people <b>were</b> walking together, <b>one</b> of whom is <b>familiar</b> with a particular location in the distance, <b>and one</b> is <b>not familiar</b> with it, <b>the one who</b> is <b>not familiar</b> with it <b>entrusts</b> his right to designate <b>his</b> residence <b>to the one who</b> is <b>familiar</b> with it, <b>and the one who</b> is <b>familiar</b> with it <b>says: My residence is in such-and-such place.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>But it is not</b> so; that is not the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Rabba <b>only taught it</b> as if it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei so that</b> Rav Yosef <b>would accept it from him, due to</b> the fact that <b>Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning</b> accompanies <b>his</b> rulings, Since the <i>halakha</i> is usually in accordance with Rav Yosei’s opinion, Rav Yosef would be less likely to raise doubts with regard to the ruling.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>If one is not familiar</b> with a tree or any other noticeable landmark, <b>or if he is not an expert</b> in the <i>halakha</i>, unaware that residence can be established from a distance, and he said: My residence is at my current location, his presence at his current location acquires for him the right to walk two thousand cubits in each direction.<br>The Gemara raises a fundamental question: <b>These two thousand cubits, where are</b> they <b>written</b> in the Torah? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Remain every man in his place”</b> (Exodus 16:29); <b>these are</b> the <b>four cubits,</b> which constitute the minimum Shabbat limit, e.g., for one who ventured beyond his prescribed limit. <b>“Let no man go out of his place”</b> (Exodus 16:29); <b>these are</b> the <b>two thousand cubits</b> of the Shabbat limit for one who remains in his place. Unless otherwise specified, the measure of one’s place is two thousand cubits.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is the measure of one’s place? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: We derive</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>place</b> written here: “Let no man go out of his place,” and <b>from</b> the term <b>place</b> written with regard to an unwitting murderer: “Then I will appoint you a place to where he shall flee” (Exodus 21:13). This last verse mentions both place and fleeing, <b>and</b> the term <b>place</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing. And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing,</b> written in a different verse with regard to the unwitting murderer: “But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge, whither he has fled” (Numbers 35:26). <b>And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> which appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> as it states there: “And the avenger of blood find him outside [<i>miḥutz</i>] the borders of the city of his refuge” (Numbers 35:27). Since this verse mentions both the term border and the term outside, the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>outside. And</b> the term <b>outside</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>outside, as it is written</b> with regard to the Levite cities, which also served as cities of refuge: <b>“And you shall measure from outside [<i>miḥutz</i>] the city on the east side two thousand cubits,</b> and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:5). From this chain of identical terms, the meaning of the term place stated in connection with Shabbat is derived from the two thousand cubits mentioned with regard to the Levite cities.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But let us derive</b> instead by means of a verbal analogy between the term outside in the verse: “Outside the borders of the city of refuge,” and the term outside in the verse: <b>“From the wall of the city outward [<i>vaḥutza</i>] a thousand cubits”</b> (Numbers 35:4), that the Shabbat limit measures only a thousand cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the term <b>outside [<i>ḥutz</i>]</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> another instance of the term <b>outside [<i>ḥutz</i>], but one does not derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>outside from</b> the term <b>outward [<i>ḥutza</i>].</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What is</b> significant about <b>the difference</b> between the two terms? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days; <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming;</b> it is after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference of one letter between <i>ḥutz</i> and <i>ḥutza</i>, should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy.<br>Gemara rejects this argument: <b>This applies</b> only <b>when there are no terms</b> that are <b>identical to it however, where there are terms</b> that are <b>identical to it, we derive</b> the verbal analogy <b>from</b> terms <b>identical to it,</b> rather than from the terms that are not precisely identical.<br>The <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna disagree whether the <b>two-thousand-cubit</b> limit granted to a person in every direction is measured as a <b>circle</b> or as a square tablet. The Gemara poses a question: With regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigenos</b> that the limit is measured as a circle, <b>no matter what</b> you say, it is difficult. <b>If he is of the</b> opinion that there is a <b>verbal analogy</b> from the verse written with regard to the Levite cities it is difficult, because <b>sides</b> is the term <b>written,</b> indicating squared boundaries. And <b>if he is not of the</b> opinion that there is a <b>verbal analogy, from where does he</b> derive that the Shabbat limit is <b>two thousand cubits?</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he is of</b> the opinion that there is <b>a verbal analogy, but here,</b> with regard to the Levite cities, it <b>is different, as the verse says: “This shall be to them the open space of the cities”</b> (Numbers 35:5), from which it is inferred: <b>To this,</b> the open space of the city, <b>you</b> should <b>provide sides</b> and square it, <b>but you do not provide sides to those resting on Shabbat.</b> Instead, those who establish Shabbat residence are provided with a circular, two-thousand-cubit limit.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> understand the emphasis placed on the word this in the verse? The Gemara answers: As <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Ḥananya says: Like this</b> measure <b>shall be</b> the calculations of measures for <b>all those who rest on Shabbat,</b> i.e., square.<br><b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: One who carries</b> an object <b>four cubits in the public domain is only liable if he carries</b> it <b>four</b> cubits <b>with their diagonal.</b> The four cubits mentioned in many places is only the basic measure by which the distance beyond which it is prohibited to carry is calculated. However, in practice, a person is liable only if he carries the object the length of the diagonal of a square with four-cubit sides.<br><b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>Rava</b> once <b>tested us</b> by asking: With regard to <b>a pillar in the public domain, ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide, must</b> the width <b>be</b> four handbreadths <b>with their diagonal</b> in order to be regarded a private domain, <b>or not? And we said to him: Is this not</b> that which was taught by <b>Rav Ḥananya? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rav Ḥananya says: Like this</b> measure <b>shall be</b> that of <b>all those who rest on Shabbat,</b> indicating that the diagonal is the determining measure for the <i>halakhot</i> of rest on Shabbat.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said: A pauper can establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet,</b> i.e., one who does not have the bread required to establish an <i>eiruv</i> may walk anywhere within his Shabbat limit and acquire residence. <b>We have</b> this leniency in effect <b>only</b> for <b>a pauper,</b> who does not have food for two meals. However, one who has bread may only establish residence with bread. Rabbi Yehuda says: This leniency is in effect for both a pauper and a wealthy person.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the person said: My residence is in <b>my</b> current <b>location. As Rabbi Meir maintains: The primary</b> ordinance and establishment <b>of <i>eiruv</i></b> is <b>with bread.</b><br><br>Daf 51b<br><br>Therefore, <b>it is</b> only <b>with regard to a pauper,</b> who does not have food for two meals, <b>that the Sages were lenient</b> and permitted him to establish residence merely by saying: My residence is in my current location. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a wealthy person</b> in his own house who has bread, <b>no,</b> they did not permit him to do so.<br><b>And Rabbi Yehuda maintains: The primary</b> ordinance <b>of <i>eiruv</i> is by foot,</b> i.e., by going and stating that he is establishing his residence in that location, and therefore it applies to <b>both a pauper and a wealthy person. However,</b> with regard a case when the person said: My residence is <b>in such-and-such place,</b> and he is not there, <b>everyone,</b> both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agrees</b> that for <b>a pauper</b> on the road on a Shabbat eve, <b>yes, an</b> <i>eiruv</i> may be established in that manner; however, for <b>a wealthy person, no,</b> an eiruv may not be established in that manner.<br>And as for the mishna’s statement: <b>And this is what</b> the Sages meant when <b>they said</b> that a pauper can establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet, <b>who,</b> which Sage, <b>is teaching it?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Meir. And to which</b> clause of the mishna <b>is it referring?</b> It refers to the previous statement: If he is <b>not familiar</b> with a tree or any other noticeable landmark, <b>or if he is not an expert in the <i>halakha</i>,</b> and therefore is unaware that a residence can be established from a distance, and said: My residence is in my current location, he acquires two thousand cubits in each direction. <b>And</b> as for the statement in the continuation of the mishna: The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with bread only to be lenient with the wealthy</b> person, <b>who,</b> which Sage, <b>is teaching it?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that the option of establishing an <i>eiruv</i> by foot is available to the wealthy as well.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> however, disagreed with Rav Naḥman and <b>said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna is with regard to a person who said: My residence is <b>in such-and-such place,</b> in which case his residence is neither acquired by foot nor with bread. <b>As Rabbi Meir maintains: A pauper, yes,</b> he establishes residence with an <i>eiruv</i> in that manner; however, <b>a wealthy person, no,</b> he does not. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda maintains: Both a pauper and a wealthy person</b> may establish an <i>eiruv</i> in that manner. <b>However,</b> in a case where one said: My residence is <b>in my</b> present <b>location, everyone,</b> both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agrees</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> of this kind is effective <b>both</b> for <b>a pauper and</b> for <b>a wealthy person,</b> as everyone agrees agree that <b>the primary</b> ordinance <b>of <i>eiruv</i> is by foot.</b><br>And as for the mishna’s statement: <b>And this is what</b> the Sages meant when <b>they said</b> that <b>a pauper</b> can establish an <i>eiruv</i> by foot, <b>who is teaching it?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Meir. And to which</b> clause of the mishna <b>is it referring?</b> It is referring <b>to this</b> clause: <b>One who was coming along the way</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling. According to Rabbi Yehuda, he could have established an <i>eiruv</i> even if he was in his house. And as for the statement in the continuation of the mishna: The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with bread only</b> in order <b>to be lenient with the wealthy</b> person, <b>who is teaching it? Everyone agrees</b> with this <i>halakha</i>, and it is taught according to both opinions.<br>The Gemara comments: A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> who said that the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is with regard to one who said: My residence is in my present location. It was stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both a pauper and a wealthy person establish an <i>eiruv</i> with bread; however a wealthy person may not go out beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit and say: My residence is in my</b> present <b>location, because</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one can establish an <i>eiruv</i> by foot only</b> in the case of <b>a person who was coming along the way and it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Both a pauper and a wealthy person establish an <i>eiruv</i> by foot. And a wealthy person will go out beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit and say: My residence is in my</b> present <b>location. And this is the primary</b> ordinance <b>of <i>eiruv</i>. However, the Sages permitted a homeowner to send his <i>eiruv</i> in the hand of his servant,</b> or <b>in the hand of his son,</b> or <b>in the hand of his agent,</b> in order <b>to be lenient with him,</b> so that he need not exert himself and go out and establish an <i>eiruv</i> by foot. This <i>baraita</i> presents the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda as it was delineated by Rav Naḥman.<br>The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving the members of the household of</b> the <b>Memel</b> family <b>and members of the household of Guryon</b> family <b>in</b> the village of <b>Aroma, who were distributing dried figs and raisins to the paupers in years of famine, and the paupers of the village of Siḥin and the paupers of the village of Ḥananya would come</b> to the edge of the Shabbat <b>limit at nightfall,</b> which was also within the Shabbat limit of Aroma, and then go home. <b>The following day they would rise early and go</b> to receive their figs and raisins. Apparently, one can establish an <i>eiruv</i> by foot, if he says: My residence is in my present location.<br><b>Rav Ashi said: The</b> formulation of the <b>mishna is also precise,</b> in accordance with Rav Naḥman’s explanation, <b>as it teaches: If</b> on a Shabbat eve <b>one set out to go to a city for which an <i>eiruv</i> is established</b> enabling him to go there on Shabbat, <b>and another</b> person <b>caused him to return</b> home, <b>he</b> himself <b>is permitted to go</b> to that city on Shabbat, <b>and</b> for <b>all the</b> other <b>residents of the town it is prohibited</b> to go there. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br><b>And we discussed</b> this mishna and raised a difficulty: <b>What is different</b> about <b>him and what is different</b> about <b>them?</b> Why is he permitted to proceed to the other town while it is prohibited for the other residents to do so? <b>And Rav Huna said: We are dealing here with</b> a case <b>where he has</b> two <b>houses,</b> one in each city, <b>and</b> there is the distance of <b>two Shabbat limits,</b> four thousand cubits, <b>between them.</b><br>With regard to <b>him, since he set out on his way, his</b> legal status <b>is</b> that of <b>a pauper,</b> as he did not intend to return to his first house, but to continue to his other house. Therefore, he can establish residence at the end of his Shabbat limit by verbal means alone.<br><b>And</b> the legal status of <b>these</b> other inhabitants of his city, <b>is</b> that of <b>wealthy people,</b> as they are in their houses and have food. Consequently, they can only establish residence at the end of their Shabbat limit by depositing food there prior the onset of Shabbat. <b>Apparently, everything</b> stated with regard to one who says: My residence is <b>in such-and-such place;</b> to <b>a pauper, yes,</b> it applies to <b>a wealthy person, no,</b> it does not apply. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is the case.<br><b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi was teaching</b> the mishna to <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav.</b> He stated that this leniency applies <b>both to a pauper and to a wealthy person. Rav said to him: Conclude</b> your statement <b>also: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br>The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan was in the habit</b> of <b>coming from</b> his home in <b>Artibbena to Pumbedita</b> on Shabbat.<br><br></body></html>
