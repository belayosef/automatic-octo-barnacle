Daf 36a<br><br><b>Rava said:</b> That is not the way to resolve the apparent contradiction between the two rulings; rather, there is a difference between the cases with regard to the ritual impurity itself: <b>There,</b> with regard to touching a person who was later found dead, there are <b>two presumptions</b> supporting <b>leniency,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> with respect to the <i>teruma</i> being used for an <i>eiruv</i>, there is only <b>one presumption</b> supporting <b>leniency.</b> How so? With regard to one who touched another person who was later found to be dead, there are two presumptions of purity: Firstly, the person who was found dead was previously alive, and the presumption is that he remained in that state until we know with certainty that he was dead. Secondly, the one who touched that person was previously pure, and he remains in that presumptive state until we know with certainty that he became impure. Therefore, Rabbi Meir had adequate reason to be lenient. However, with regard to <i>teruma</i>, only one presumption exists, that the <i>teruma</i> was previously pure and presumably remained in that state until proven otherwise. Since there is no additional presumption, Rabbi Meir ruled stringently.<br>All the difficulties raised above are based on the seemingly conflicting statements of Rabbi Meir. Yet it would appear that there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei and</b> another statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> for he was stringent with regard to the doubts involving ritual baths but lenient with regard to doubts involving <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said:</b> The law with regard to ritual <b>impurity is different, since it has a basis in the Torah.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yosei was stringent even with respect to immersion performed in order to remove impurity that is only of rabbinic origin. The Gemara asks: The prohibitions of <b>Shabbat</b> limits <b>are also</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law;</b> why isn’t Rabbi Yosei stringent about them as well? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yosei holds:</b> The laws of Shabbat <b>limits</b> are by <b>rabbinic</b> law, not by Torah law.<br><b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>This</b> stringent ruling <b>is his; that</b> lenient ruling with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> <b>is his teacher’s.</b> The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The Sage <b>Avtolemos testified in the name of five Elders that an <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt is valid.</b> This formulation indicates that Rabbi Yosei was merely reporting a ruling that he had heard from his teacher, although he may not have accepted it. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that this resolution of the contradiction is correct.<br><b>Rava said</b> that a different resolution of the contradiction may be suggested: <b>There,</b> with regard to ritual baths, <b>this is the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi Yosei’s</b> opinion: <b>Keep the impure</b> person <b>in his presumptive state</b> of ritual impurity, <b>and say</b> that <b>he did not</b> properly <b>immerse</b> himself.<br>The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary, keep the ritual bath in its presumptive state</b> of validity <b>and say that</b> the ritual bath <b>was not lacking</b> the requisite measure of water. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with <b>a ritual bath that had not been</b> previously <b>measured</b> to determine whether it contained forty <i>se’a</i>, and therefore it had no prior presumption of validity.<br><b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>In what case did Rabbi Yosei say that an <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt is</b> nevertheless <b>valid?</b> For example, if <b>one established an <i>eiruv</i> with <i>teruma</i></b> that had been ritually pure but later became impure, and there is <b>doubt whether it became impure while it was still day,</b> before the onset of Shabbat, or <b>whether it became impure</b> only <b>after nightfall, and similarly,</b> if one made an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> untithed <b>produce</b> that was later tithed and thereby became permissible for eating, and there is <b>doubt whether it was rendered fit while it was still day,</b> before the onset of Shabbat, or <b>whether it was rendered fit</b> only <b>after nightfall, this is an <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt</b> which Rabbi Yosei said <b>is valid.</b><br><b>However, if one established an <i>eiruv</i> with <i>teruma</i></b> about which <b>there was doubt whether it was</b> ritually <b>pure or</b> ritually <b>impure</b> from the outset; <b>and similarly,</b> if one established an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with produce</b> about which <b>there was doubt</b> from the outset <b>whether it had been</b> tithed and thereby <b>rendered fit</b> or <b>whether it had not been</b> tithed and thereby <b>rendered fit, this is not</b> a case of <b>an <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt</b> that Rabbi Yosei said <b>is valid.</b><br>The Gemara raises a question in order to clarify the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>What is different</b> about <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> with regard to <b>which</b> we <b>say: Keep the <i>teruma</i> in its presumptive state</b> of ritual purity, <b>and say</b> that <b>it was</b> still <b>pure</b> at the onset of Shabbat, since it had been previously pure and it is not known when it became impure? According to that reasoning, with regard to untithed <b>produce [<i>tevel</i>]</b> it should <b>also</b> be said: <b>Keep the untithed produce in its presumptive state,</b> as the produce had certainly been untithed originally, <b>and say that it was not</b> tithed and thereby <b>rendered fit</b> prior to the onset of Shabbat.<br>Rather, emend the wording of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Do not say:</b> There is <b>doubt whether it was rendered fit while it was still day,</b> before the onset of Shabbat. <b>Rather, say:</b> There is <b>doubt whether</b> regular produce <b>became mixed</b> with untithed produce <b>while it was still day,</b> or <b>whether it became mixed</b> only <b>after nightfall.</b> In other words, one used regular food to establish his <i>eiruv</i>, but then <i>tevel</i> was mixed with that food, prohibiting the entire mixture from being consumed until tithes are separated for the <i>tevel</i>. However, there is doubt whether the produce became mixed with the <i>tevel</i> while it was still day, in which case the <i>eiruv</i> is invalid, or whether it became mixed only after nightfall, in which case the <i>eiruv</i> is valid. In that case, we say: Keep the produce in its presumptive state and say that it was not mixed with <i>tevel</i> during the day, and therefore the <i>eiruv</i> is valid.<br><b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak raised a dilemma to Rav Huna:</b> If <b>there were two loaves of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>before</b> someone, <b>one</b> that was ritually <b>impure and one</b> that was ritually <b>pure,</b> and he did not know which one was pure; <b>and he said: Establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> <i>teḥumin</i> <b>for me with the pure</b> loaf, <b>wherever it is,</b> i.e., even though I do not know which it is, I wish to establish my Shabbat residence at the location of the pure loaf, and those present placed both loaves in the same place, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this a valid <i>eiruv</i> or not?<br>The Gemara clarifies: The question may <b>be asked according to</b> the stringent opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and it may <b>be asked according to</b> the lenient opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The question may <b>be asked according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> in the following manner: Perhaps <b>Rabbi Meir only stated</b> his stringent opinion with regard to a questionable <i>eiruv</i> <b>there, where there is no</b> <i>teruma</i> that is definitely <b>pure</b> present, but only <i>teruma</i> whose purity is in doubt. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>there</b> definitely <b>is a pure</b> loaf, and therefore even Rabbi Meir may agree to rule leniently. <b>Or perhaps</b> it may be argued that <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, he only said</b> that we are lenient with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> whose validity is in doubt in the case dealt with <b>there,</b> where, <b>if indeed</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>is pure, he knows</b> where <b>it</b> is; <b>but here, he does not know</b> how to identify <b>it.</b><br>Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak: <b>According to both</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, we require</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> consist of <b>a meal that is fit</b> to be eaten <b>while it is still day,</b> prior to the onset of Shabbat, <b>and</b> in this case <b>there is none.</b> Due to the uncertainty as to which loaf is pure and which is impure, neither of the two loaves may be eaten, and an <i>eiruv</i> made with food that may not be eaten while it is still day is not a valid <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rava raised</b> another <b>dilemma to Rav Naḥman:</b> If one said: <b>This loaf</b> shall remain <b>unconsecrated today, and tomorrow</b> it shall be <b>consecrated, and he</b> then <b>said: Establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me with this</b> loaf, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that since the twilight period’s status as part of the previous day or part of the day that follows is questionable, the consecration of the loaf may take effect before the <i>eiruv</i> establishes one’s Shabbat residence, and since an <i>eiruv</i> cannot be made with a consecrated object, the <i>eiruv</i> is not valid? Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: In that case, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b><br>Rava then asked about one who made the opposite statement: This loaf shall be <b>consecrated today, and tomorrow</b> it shall be <b>unconsecrated,</b> i.e., it shall be redeemed with money that I have in my house, <b>and he</b> then <b>said: Establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me with this</b> loaf, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: His <i>eiruv</i> is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> Rava asked him: <b>What is different</b> between the two cases? If we are lenient with regard to the twilight period, we should be lenient in both cases.<br>Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava in jest: <b>After you eat a <i>kor</i> of salt over it,</b> and analyze the matter at length, you will be able to understand the difference. The difference is obvious: When one says that <b>today</b> the loaf shall remain <b>unconsecrated, and tomorrow</b> it shall be <b>consecrated,</b> we do <b>not</b> assume <b>out of doubt</b> that <b>sanctity has descended upon</b> the loaf. Therefore, the loaf remains in its presumptive state of being unconsecrated during the twilight period, and the <i>eiruv</i> is valid. With regard to the opposite case, however, when one says that <b>today</b> the loaf shall be <b>consecrated, and tomorrow</b> it shall be <b>unconsecrated,</b> we do <b>not</b> assume <b>out of doubt</b> that the loaf’s <b>sanctity has departed from it.</b> The loaf remains in its presumptive state of consecration for the duration of the twilight period, and therefore the <i>eiruv</i> is invalid.<br><b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> If <b>one filled a flask that was immersed during the day [<i>tevul yom</i>]</b> but does not become fully ritually pure until night <b>from a barrel of tithe</b> that was still <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> meaning that the produce inside was first tithe from which <i>teruma</i> of the tithe had not yet been separated, <b>and he said: Let</b> the contents of <b>this</b> flask <b>be <i>teruma</i> of the tithe</b> for the contents of the barrel <b>when night falls, his statement takes effect.</b> If he were to say that the designated portion should immediately become <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe would be defiled by the flask that is still a <i>tevul yom</i>. Once night falls, however, the flask is absolutely pure, and if the designation of the flask’s contents as <i>teruma</i> of the tithe takes effect at that time, the produce remains pure. The mishna teaches that <i>teruma</i> of the tithe can be separated in this manner.<br>The mishna continues: <b>And if he said: Establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me with</b> the contents of <b>this</b> flask, <b>he has not said anything,</b> as the contents of the flask are still <i>tevel</i>. <b>Rava said: That is to say</b> that <b>the end of the day</b> is when <b>the <i>eiruv</i> acquires</b> one’s Shabbat residence. The critical time with respect to an <i>eiruv</i> is the last moment of Shabbat eve, rather than the first moment of Shabbat.<br><br>Daf 36b<br><br><b>As, if it should enter your mind</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> acquires</b> one’s Shabbat residence at <b>the beginning of the day</b> of Shabbat, then <b>if he said: Establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me with</b> the produce in <b>this</b> flask, <b>why hasn’t he said anything?</b> After nightfall, when Shabbat begins, the flask is already pure, and therefore the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe inside it is also pure and is suitable for an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is no proof; <b>even if you say</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> acquires</b> one’s Shabbat residence at <b>the beginning of the day</b> of Shabbat, nonetheless, <b>we require a meal that is fit</b> to be eaten <b>while it is still day,</b> prior to the onset of Shabbat, in order for the <i>eiruv</i> to be valid, <b>and there is none</b> in this case. While it was still day, it was certainly prohibited to consume the contents of the flask, which were still <i>tevel</i>, and therefore it could not be used as an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may make a condition with regard to his <i>eiruv</i></b> of Shabbat borders. In other words, he need not decide in advance in which direction his <i>eiruv</i> should take effect. For example, he may deposit an <i>eiruv</i> on each of two opposite sides of his town, <b>and say: If gentiles come from the east, my <i>eiruv</i> is in the west,</b> so that I can escape in that direction; and if they come <b>from the west, my <i>eiruv</i> is in the east. If they come from here and from there,</b> i.e., from both directions, <b>I will go wherever I wish,</b> and my <i>eiruv</i> will retroactively take effect in that direction; and <b>if they do not come</b> at all, <b>neither from here nor from there, I will be like</b> the rest of <b>the inhabitants of my town</b> and give up both <i>eiruvin</i> that I deposited, leaving me with two thousand cubits in all directions from the town.<br>Similarly, one may say: <b>If a Sage comes from the east</b> and he is spending Shabbat beyond the boundaries of my town, <b>my <i>eiruv</i> is in the east,</b> so that I may go out to greet him there; and if he comes <b>from the west, my <i>eiruv</i> is in the west.</b> If one Sage <b>comes from here, and</b> another Sage comes <b>from there, I will go wherever I wish; and</b> if no Sage comes, <b>neither from here nor from there, I will be like</b> the rest of <b>the inhabitants of my town. Rabbi Yehuda says: If one of</b> the Sages coming from opposite directions <b>was his teacher, he may go</b> only <b>to his teacher,</b> as it is assumed that was his original intention. <b>And if they were both his teachers,</b> so that there is no reason to suppose that he preferred one over the other, <b>he may go wherever he wishes.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates that <b>when Rabbi Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he taught all</b> of the laws in <b>the mishna in the opposite</b> manner. That is to say, according to him, if the gentiles came from the east, his <i>eiruv</i> would be to the east, and, conversely, if the Sage came from the east, his <i>eiruv</i> would be to the west. This is <b>difficult</b> because if this is correct, there is a contradiction <b>between</b> the ruling concerning <b>gentiles</b> in the mishna and the ruling concerning <b>gentiles</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and</b> similarly there is a contradiction <b>between</b> the ruling concerning <b>a Sage</b> in the mishna <b>and</b> the ruling concerning <b>a Sage</b> in the <i>baraita</i>.<br>The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction <b>between</b> the ruling concerning <b>gentiles</b> in the mishna <b>and</b> the ruling concerning <b>gentiles</b> in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>not difficult: This</b> case in the mishna is referring to <b>a tax collector [<i>parhagabena</i>],</b> from whom one wishes to flee; whereas <b>that</b> case in the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the lord of the town,</b> with whom he wishes to speak. Therefore, there are times that one wants to go out toward the gentile, while at other times one wants to flee from him.<br>Similarly, the apparent contradiction <b>between</b> the ruling concerning <b>a Sage</b> in the mishna <b>and</b> the ruling concerning <b>a Sage</b> in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>not difficult: This</b> case in the mishna is referring to a scholar <b>who sits</b> and delivers public Torah <b>lectures,</b> and one wishes to come and learn Torah from him; whereas <b>that</b> case in the <i>baraita</i> is referring to one <b>who teaches</b> children how to <b>recite</b> the <b><i>Shema</i>,</b> i.e., one who teaches young children how to pray, of whom he has no need. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that if a scholar came from one direction to deliver a public lecture and the school teacher came from the opposite direction, his <i>eiruv</i> is in the direction of the scholar.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If one of</b> the Sages <b>was</b> his teacher, he may go only to his teacher, as we can assume that this was his original intention. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reason that <b>the Rabbis</b> do not accept this straightforward argument? The Gemara answers: The Rabbis maintain that <b>sometimes</b> one <b>prefers</b> to meet the Sage who is <b>his colleague rather than</b> the Sage who is <b>his teacher,</b> as sometimes one learns more from his peers than from his teachers.<br><b>Rav said:</b> This version of <b>the mishna</b> should <b>not</b> be accepted <b>because of what</b> the Sage <b>Ayo taught</b> to the opposite effect, <b>as Ayo taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person cannot make conditions about two things at once,</b> i.e., he cannot say that if one Sage comes from one direction and another Sage comes from the other direction, he will go wherever he wishes. <b>Rather,</b> he may say that <b>if a Sage came from the east, his <i>eiruv</i> is in the east, and if a Sage came from the west, his <i>eiruv</i> is in the west. But</b> he may <b>not</b> say that if one Sage came <b>from here, and</b> another Sage came <b>from there,</b> he will go wherever he wishes.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a case in which one stipulated that if Sages came <b>from here and from there</b> he may go to whichever side he chooses, such <b>that</b> his <i>eiruv</i> <b>is not</b> effective? Apparently, this is due to the principle that <b>there is no retroactive designation,</b> meaning that a doubtful state of affairs cannot be clarified retroactively. However, according to this principle, when one established an <i>eiruv</i> <b>to the east</b> and <b>to the west</b> in order to be able to travel in the direction of one Sage who comes toward the town in a case where one does not know in advance from which direction he will come, we should <b>also</b> invoke the principle that <b>there is no retroactive designation.</b> Therefore, even if one deposited an <i>eiruv</i> at both ends of his town for the sake of one Sage who might come from either side, he should not be able to rely on what becomes clarified afterward and decide retroactively which <i>eiruv</i> he is interested in.<br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is not a true case of retroactive designation, as <b>the Sage had already come</b> by twilight but the person who established the <i>eiruv</i> did not yet know which side of the town the Sage had come toward. Therefore, at the time the <i>eiruv</i> establishes his Shabbat residence it is clear which <i>eiruv</i> the person wants, even though he himself will only become aware of that later.<br>The Gemara poses a question with regard to Rav’s statement cited above: Why should we reject the mishna because of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>On the contrary,</b> let us say that the ruling of <b>Ayo</b> should <b>not</b> be accepted <b>because of the mishna.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to uphold the mishna’s ruling because it contradicts other sources, <b>as we have</b> already <b>heard that Rabbi Yehuda does not</b> accept the principle of <b>retroactive designation. As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who buys wine from among the Samaritans [<i>Kutim</i>],</b> who do not tithe their produce properly,<br><br></body></html>
