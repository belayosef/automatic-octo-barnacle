Daf 31a<br><br><b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a priest who is</b> ritually <b>pure with <i>teruma</i> that is</b> ritually <b>pure</b> and resting <b>on a grave,</b> even though the location is impure and he cannot reach it. <b>How does he go</b> there? <b>In a carriage, crate, or cupboard,</b> which shield him from the ritual impurity.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it true that <b>once</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>was placed</b> directly on the grave, the <i>teruma</i> <b>became defiled,</b> and ritually impure <i>teruma</i> is not fit to be eaten by anyone? The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <b>where</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>had not yet been rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, as it had not yet come into contact with a liquid. Produce that has yet to come into contact with a liquid does not contract impurity. <b>Or</b> we are dealing with bread <b>that was kneaded with fruit juice,</b> which is not one of the seven liquids that render a food susceptible to ritual impurity.<br>The Gemara now asks: <b>How can he bring it</b> from where it is resting on the grave in order to eat it? The Gemara answers: <b>With flat wooden utensils</b> that are not shaped as receptacles and therefore <b>do not contract</b> ritual <b>impurity.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the utensil <b>cover</b> the grave? The Sages decreed that anyone who holds a utensil that is a handbreadth wide over a corpse or grave is ritually impure. The Gemara answers: <b>He may bring it on the edge</b> of the utensil while holding the utensil sideways so that it does not form a cover that is a handbreadth wide over the grave.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> and there is a way for the <i>teruma</i> to remain ritually pure and for the priest to access it, <b>what is the reason</b> the Sages disagreed with Rabbi Yehuda and did not allow an <i>eiruv</i> to be established for a priest on a grave? The Gemara answers: <b>They hold</b> that <b>it is prohibited to acquire a home with items from which benefit is prohibited.</b> It is prohibited to derive benefit from a grave. Since one acquires a place of residence for Shabbat by means of the <i>eiruv</i>, it would be as if the priest acquired a home for himself with something from which he may not derive benefit.<br>The Gemara asks: If so, does this prove <b>by inference that Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> to acquire a home with items from which benefit is prohibited? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit.</b> The fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit. Since the acquisition of a place of residence by means of an <i>eiruv</i> is a mitzva, as one may establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, it is even permitted to establish one’s <i>eiruv</i> in a place from which it is prohibited to benefit.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> if so, with regard to <b>that which Rava said: Mitzvot were not given for benefit, let us say</b> that <b>he stated his <i>halakha</i></b> only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of one side in a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: If they hold that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, all would agree</b> that the <i>eiruv</i> may be placed on a grave because <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit.</b> However, the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Sages centers on a different aspect of the issue. <b>Here, they disagree with regard to this: One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva.</b> Since mitzvot do not constitute forbidden benefit, it is therefore permitted to make use of the grave. <b>And one Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> even for a voluntary matter.</b> Establishing a Shabbat residence on the site of a grave by means of an <i>eiruv</i> made for a voluntary matter is regarded as forbidden benefit, and therefore it is prohibited.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> if so, with regard to <b>that which Rav Yosef said</b> as a general principle: <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, let us say</b> that <b>he stated his <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> one side in a dispute between the <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yosef</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> In fact, <b>all agree</b> that <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, and all agree</b> that <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit, and they disagree with regard to this: One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: Once</b> he <b>acquired his</b> Shabbat residence at twilight by means of the <b><i>eiruv</i>, he is indifferent to its safeguarding,</b> as his main goal has already been achieved. He has no further need for the food used for the <i>eiruv</i>, and therefore, he receives no benefit from its placement on the grave. <b>And one Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: It is pleasing to him that</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>is safeguarded, for if he needs</b> it the next day, <b>he can eat it.</b> According to this opinion, he would be making prohibited use of the grave to preserve his meal for the following day, and therefore the Sages prohibited placing an <i>eiruv</i> on a grave.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with <i>demai</i>,</b> produce purchased from one who may not have separated the required tithes, <b>and</b> similarly, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> the <b>first tithe whose <i>teruma</i> has been taken</b> in order to be given to a priest, <b>and with</b> the <b>second tithe and consecrated articles that have been redeemed; and priests</b> may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of dough that must be given to a priest.<br><b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>tevel</i>,</b> produce from which the priestly dues [<i>teruma</i>] and other tithes have not been separated, <b>nor with first tithe whose <i>teruma</i>,</b> which must be given to a priest, <b>has not been taken, nor with</b> the <b>second tithe or consecrated articles that have not been redeemed.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: How can one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with <b><i>demai</i>? Isn’t it unfit for him?</b> Since it is prohibited to eat <i>demai</i>, how can it be used as an <i>eiruv</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Since if he wants, he could declare his property ownerless, and he would be a poor</b> person, <b>and</b> the <i>demai</i> would then <b>be fit for him,</b> as a poor person is permitted to eat <i>demai</i>, <b>now too,</b> even though he has not renounced ownership of his property, <b>it is</b> considered <b>fit for him</b> to use as an <i>eiruv</i>. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may feed the poor <i>demai</i>,</b><br><br>Daf 31b<br><br><b>and</b> one may also feed <b>soldiers <i>demai</i>.</b><br><b>Rav Huna said: It was taught</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not feed the impoverished <i>demai</i>. And Beit Hillel say: One may feed the impoverished <i>demai</i>.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.<br>We learned in the mishna: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with first tithe</b> whose <i>teruma</i> <b>has been taken.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <i>teruma</i> was already taken there is no problem. Why is it necessary to state it may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is only necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case where the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks,</b> i.e., the Levite took his tithe before the grain was threshed and before the priest took the <i>teruma</i>; <b>and the <i>teruma</i> of the tithes was taken from it</b> but <b><i>teruma gedola</i> was not taken from it.</b> Therefore, since the <i>teruma</i> is generally separated first, a portion of the first tithe that the Levite took should have been separated as <i>teruma</i>.<br><b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion that <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> said that <b>Reish Lakish said, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: First tithe,</b> in a case <b>where</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks, is exempt from <i>teruma gedola</i>, as it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a gift for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe”</b> (Numbers 18:26), from which the following inference is made: <b>A tenth part of the tithe,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>I told you,</b> the Levite, to separate. <b>And</b> I did <b>not</b> tell you to separate <b><i>teruma gedola</i> and the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b><br>With regard to this matter, <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so, even</b> if the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest after the kernels of grain were removed from the stalks and placed <b>in a pile,</b> the Levite should still not have to separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. Abaye <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states: “From all that is given to you, you shall set apart that which is the Lord’s <i>teruma</i>”</b> (Numbers 18:29). The inclusive phrase “from all” indicates that <i>teruma gedola</i> must be separated even from the first tithe in the case where the Levite precedes the priest after the grain has been collected in a pile.<br>Rav Pappa asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to expound one verse as exempting the Levite from separating <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that has been separated while the grain was on the stalks, and to expound another verse as requiring <i>teruma gedola</i> to be separated when the Levite took his first tithe after the grain was collected in a pile? Abaye answers: <b>This</b> produce, which has been threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that</b> produce, which remained on the stalks, <b>did not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> The wording of the biblical verses indicates that the requirement to separate <i>teruma</i> applies only to grain, whereas the produce is not considered grain until it has been threshed.<br>The mishna also stated that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> the <b>second tithe and consecrated</b> food <b>that have been redeemed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is obvious</b> that these foods may be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>was only needed</b> for a case <b>where one</b> redeemed the second tithe or consecrated food and <b>paid the principle but did not pay the</b> additional <b>fifth</b> of their value, which must be paid when they are redeemed. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the failure to pay <b>the</b> additional <b>fifth does not invalidate</b> the redemption. Once the principle is paid, even if payment of the additional fifth is still outstanding, the article is regarded as redeemed and may be used for mundane purposes.<br>The mishna further states: <b>But</b> one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>tevel</i>,</b> produce from which the priestly dues and other tithes have not been separated. The Gemara asks: This too is <b>obvious,</b> as it is prohibited to eat or derive any benefit from <i>tevel</i>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is only needed with regard to <i>tevel</i> that is considered <i>tevel</i> by rabbinic decree.</b> What is included in this category? <b>For example, if one planted</b> seeds <b>in an imperforated container,</b> one is exempt by Torah law from separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the resulting produce because Torah law does not consider produce grown in such a container to have grown from the ground.<br>The mishna stated that one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with first tithe whose <i>teruma</i> has not been taken.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is obvious,</b> as such produce is <i>tevel</i>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is only needed</b> for a case where the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest and took first tithe from <b>the pile, and</b> only <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe was taken from it,</b> but <b><i>teruma gedola</i> was not taken from it,</b> and the produce is therefore still <i>tevel</i>.<br><b>Lest you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that case is <b>as Rav Pappa said to Abaye,</b> and the Levite is exempt from separating <i>teruma gedola</i>, and therefore the food may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, the mishna <b>teaches us as</b> Abaye <b>responded to</b> Rav Pappa: If the Levite takes grain after it had been gathered in a pile, he must separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. Until he does so the produce may not be eaten.<br>We also learned in the mishna that one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> the <b>second tithe or consecrated</b> food <b>that have not been redeemed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is obvious</b> that these items may not be used.<br>The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is only needed</b> for a case <b>where he redeemed them,</b> but <b>did not redeem them properly,</b> e.g., in the case of <b>second tithe that was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>]. And the Torah says</b> with regard to the redemption of the second tithe: <b>And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money</b> in your hand” (Deuteronomy 14:25). This is expounded to mean that the second tithe may only be redeemed with <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it;</b> however, unminted coins are not considered money for the purpose of redeeming the second tithe.<br>With regard to <b>consecrated property,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where one redeemed it</b> by exchanging it <b>for land</b> instead of money, <b>as the Torah states: “He will give the money and it shall become his.”</b> Since the verse speaks of giving money, it may be inferred that consecrated property cannot be redeemed by giving the Temple treasury land of equivalent value.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one sends his <i>eiruv</i> in the hands of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> all of whom are regarded as legally incompetent, <b>or in the hands of one who does not accept</b> the principle of <b><i>eiruv</i>, it is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> But <b>if one told another</b> person <b>to receive it from him</b> at a specific location and set it down in that spot, <b>it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The critical point in the establishment of an <i>eiruv</i> is that it must be deposited in the proper location by a competent person; but it is immaterial how the <i>eiruv</i> arrives there.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Is a minor not</b> fit to set down an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Didn’t Rav Huna say: A minor may collect the</b> food for an <b><i>eiruv</i></b> from the residents of a courtyard and establish an <i>eiruv</i> on their behalf even <i>ab initio</i>? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> where the mishna invalidates an <i>eiruv</i> placed by a minor, it is referring <b>to an <i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>borders.</b> These laws are relatively stringent, as they require that one establish a new place of residence, which a minor cannot do. <b>There,</b> where Rav Huna said that a minor may collect the food for an <i>eiruv</i>, he was referring <b>to an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards.</b> This type of <i>eiruv</i> is more lenient and may be established even by a minor, as all that is necessary is to join together domains that already exist.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>Or</b> if one sends his <i>eiruv</i> <b>in the hands of one who does not accept</b> the principle of <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is this? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A Samaritan [<i>Kuti</i>],</b> who does not accept the laws of the Sages with regard to <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The mishna also states: <b>And if he told another</b> person <b>to receive</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>from him, it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>Let us be concerned that perhaps</b> the minor or other incompetent person will <b>not bring</b> the <i>eiruv</i> to the other person. The Gemara responds: This may be answered <b>as Rav Ḥisda said</b> with regard to a different statement, that it was referring to a case <b>where he stands and watches him. Here, too,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the person sending the <i>eiruv</i> <b>stands and watches him</b> from afar until the <i>eiruv</i> reaches the person designated to receive it.<br>The Gemara asks: But nonetheless, <b>let us be concerned that perhaps</b> the other person will <b>not take</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>from</b> the deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor and deposit it in the designated place. From a distance, one cannot see exactly what is happening. He only saw that the messenger arrived at his destination. The Gemara answers this question <b>as</b> follows: <b>Rav Yeḥiel said</b> in a different context that there is a legal <b>presumption</b> that <b>an agent fulfills his agency. Here, too,</b> there is a legal <b>presumption</b> that the <b>agent</b> appointed to accept the <i>eiruv</i> <b>fulfills his agency.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Where were</b> these principles of <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yeḥiel stated?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They were stated with regard to</b> the following, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one gave</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>to</b> a trained <b>elephant, and it brought it</b> to the place where he wanted the <i>eiruv</i> deposited, or if he gave it <b>to a monkey, and it brought it</b> to the proper location, <b>it is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>. But if he told another</b> person <b>to receive it from</b> the animal, <b>it is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the animal <b>will not bring</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>to</b> the person appointed to receive it? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the person sending the <i>eiruv</i> <b>stands and watches it</b> from afar until it reaches the person designated to receive the <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara asks further: But <b>perhaps</b> the person appointed to receive the <i>eiruv</i> <b>will not accept it from</b> the elephant or monkey. <b>Rav Yeḥiel said:</b> There is a legal <b>presumption</b> that <b>an agent fulfills his agency.</b><br><b>Rav Naḥman said: With regard to Torah</b> laws, we do <b>not</b> rely on the <b>presumption that an agent fulfills his agency;</b> rather, one must actually see the agent performing his mission.<br><br></body></html>
