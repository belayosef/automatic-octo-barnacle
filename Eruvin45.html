Daf 45a<br><br><b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If a person left his Shabbat limit by walking <b>two</b> cubits beyond it, <b>he may reenter</b> his original limit; but if he left his Shabbat limit by walking <b>three</b> cubits beyond it, <b>he may not reenter. What,</b> is it <b>not that Rabbi Eliezer follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, in</b> that he <b>said</b> with regard to the four cubits a person is allotted wherever he is, he is set <b>in the middle of them,</b> i.e., he may walk two cubits in each direction?<br>The Gemara explains that <b>the four cubits that the Sages gave</b> a person <b>are regarded</b> here <b>as being subsumed</b> within his original limit, <b>and</b> it is for this reason that <b>he said: He may reenter</b> his original limit. <b>Apparently</b> he is of the opinion that <b>the subsuming of</b> one Shabbat limit within another <b>is something</b> significant.<br><b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said to Abaye: Do you raise an objection against our Master,</b> Rabba, <b>from</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b> But isn’t the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer? Abaye <b>said to him: Yes, as I heard from our Master</b> himself that <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer only</b> with regard to one who went beyond his limit <b>for a voluntary matter, but</b> with regard to one who went out <b>for a mitzva matter, they agree with him</b> about the subsuming of limits, i.e., that if one limit is subsumed in another, it is permitted to pass between them. This demonstrates that the <i>halakha</i> recognizes the principle of the subsuming of limits.<br>The mishna teaches: <b>All who go out to save</b> lives <b>may return to their</b> original <b>locations</b> on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: Does this mean that he may return to his original place <b>even</b> if he went out <b>more</b> than two thousand cubits beyond his limit? <b>Didn’t the first clause say</b> that a person who was permitted to travel beyond his Shabbat limit is allotted <b>two thousand cubits, and no more?</b><br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> What this means is <b>that they may return with</b> their <b>weapons to their</b> original <b>locations,</b> provided they are within two thousand cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the difficulty</b> with returning home in this situation? <b>Perhaps</b> in the case where people went out <b>to</b> fight and <b>save</b> lives the law <b>is different,</b> and they are allowed to go home even if they went more than two thousand cubits beyond the limit.<br><b>Rather, if there is a difficulty, this is the difficulty: As we learned</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Rosh HaShana</i>, <b>at first</b> they would take the witnesses who had come to Jerusalem from a distant place on Shabbat to testify that they had seen the new moon, and bring them into a special courtyard, <b>and they would not move from there the entire day.</b> This was in accordance with the law governing one who was permitted to go out beyond his limit, as once he fulfilled his mission, he was no longer permitted to move beyond four cubits.<br>However, <b>Rabban Gamliel the Elder instituted that they</b> should <b>have two thousand cubits in each direction,</b> so that witnesses not refrain from coming to testify. <b>And</b> it is <b>not only these</b> whom the Sages <b>said</b> are given two thousand cubits in the place that they have reached, <b>but even a midwife who comes to deliver</b> a child, <b>and one who comes to rescue</b> Jews <b>from</b> an invasion of gentile <b>troops or from a river or a collapsed building or a fire; they are like the inhabitants of the town</b> at which they arrive, <b>and they have two thousand cubits in each direction.</b><br>The question may be raised: Are they given <b>no more</b> than two thousand cubits? <b>Didn’t it say</b> in the mishna: <b>All who go out to save</b> lives <b>may return to their</b> original <b>locations</b> on Shabbat, which indicates that they may walk <b>even more</b> than two thousand cubits?<br>In response, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> We must not infer from the mishna that they may go home even if they went out more than two thousand cubits from their limit, but rather <b>that they may return with</b> their <b>weapons to their</b> original <b>locations,</b> provided that they are within two thousand cubits. <b>As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>At first</b> those returning from a rescue mission <b>would place their weapons in</b> the first house that they encountered upon their return, i.e., <b>the house nearest the wall,</b> to avoid carrying on Shabbat any more than necessary.<br><b>Once,</b> their <b>enemies noticed that they</b> were no longer carrying their weapons, <b>and</b> they <b>chased after them; and</b> the defenders <b>entered</b> the house <b>to take up their weapons</b> and fight, <b>and</b> their <b>enemies entered after them,</b> causing great confusion. In the chaos, the defenders began to <b>push one another, and</b> they <b>killed more of each other than</b> their <b>enemies killed</b> of them. <b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>instituted that they should return to their locations,</b> i.e., their destinations, <b>with their weapons.</b><br>The Gemara cites an alternate resolution that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna in <i>Rosh HaShana</i> where they only permitted two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <b>where the Jews defeated the nations of the world,</b> i.e., the gentiles, in battle; in such a case there is no concern and they need not return to their original locations. Whereas <b>here,</b> in the mishna which indicates that the Sages permitted even more than two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <b>where the nations of the world defeated themselves,</b> i.e., the Jews, whom the Gemara refers to euphemistically as themselves; in such a case the Sages allowed the defeated soldiers to return to their original locations.<br>Since the Gemara discussed war on Shabbat, the Gemara cites <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>gentiles who besieged Jewish towns, they may not go out</b> to fight <b>against them with their weapons, nor may they desecrate Shabbat</b> in any other way <b>due to them,</b> but rather they must wait until after Shabbat.<br><b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with a caveat: With regard to <b>gentiles who besieged, etc. In what</b> case <b>is this said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the gentiles <b>came</b> and besieged the town <b>with regard to monetary matters,</b> i.e., banditry. <b>However, if they came with regard to lives,</b> i.e., there is concern that the gentiles will attack, <b>they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them.</b><br><b>And with regard to a town that is</b> located <b>near the border, even if</b> the gentiles <b>did not come with regard to lives, but</b> rather <b>with regard to matters of hay and straw,</b> i.e., to raid and spoil the town, <b>they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them,</b> as the border must be carefully guarded, in order to prevent enemies from gaining a foothold there.<br><b>Rav Yosef bar Manyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: And Babylonia is considered like a town</b> located <b>near the border,</b> and war may be waged there on Shabbat even if the gentiles came for financial gain. <b>And this means</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a,</b> which was located near the border.<br><b>Rabbi Dostai</b> of the town <b>of Biri expounded: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And they told David, saying: Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Ke’ila, and they rob the threshing floors”</b> (i Samuel 23:1), after which David asked God how he should respond.<br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ke’ila was a town</b> located <b>near the border,</b> and the Philistines <b>came only with regard to matters of hay and straw, as it is written: “And they rob the threshing floors.” And</b> in the next verse <b>it is written: “Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila”</b> (i Samuel 23:2), which indicates that war may be waged in a border town on Shabbat, even with regard to monetary matters.<br>The Gemara refutes this proof by asking: <b>What is</b> David’s <b>dilemma? If you say</b> that he had a halakhic question and was in doubt <b>whether it was permitted or prohibited</b> to fight the Philistines on Shabbat, it is possible to respond: <b>But the court of Samuel from Rama was</b> then <b>in existence,</b> and rather than inquire by way of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> he should have inquired of the Great Sanhedrin.<br><b>Rather,</b> he asked: <b>Will he succeed or will he not succeed</b> in his war? The Gemara comments: <b>This is also precise</b> in the language of the verse, <b>as it is written</b> in the response to David’s query: <b>“Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila.” Learn from this,</b> from the assurance that God gave David of his victory, that this was the subject of his inquiry.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a person who was sitting along the road</b> on Shabbat eve toward nightfall, unaware that he was within the city’s Shabbat limit, <b>and</b> when <b>he stood up</b> after Shabbat had already commenced, <b>he saw that he was near the town,</b> i.e., within its limit, <b>since he had not intended</b> to acquire his place of residence in the town, <b>he may not enter</b> it, but rather he measures two thousand cubits from his place; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He may enter</b> the town. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon entered</b> a town on Shabbat <b>without intention</b> from the beginning of Shabbat to establish residence in the city.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon was walking along the way</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and night fell upon him, and he spent the night outside the town. In the morning, cowherds</b> who came to graze their cattle outside the town <b>found him</b> and <b>said to him: Master, the town is before you; enter. He entered and sat in the study hall and taught the entire day.</b> This indicates that one is permitted to enter.<br>The other Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: Do you bring <b>proof from there? Perhaps he had it in mind</b> the day before to acquire residence in the city, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>the study hall was subsumed within his</b> Shabbat <b>limit.</b> If the study hall was within two thousand cubits of the spot where he established residence, all agree that he may enter there.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who was sleeping along the road</b> on Shabbat eve <b>and did not know that night had fallen, he has two thousand cubits in each direction;</b> this is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who maintains that knowledge and awareness are not necessary for one to acquire residence, but rather, a person’s presence in a given location establishes residence there.<br><b>But the Rabbis say: He has only four cubits,</b> as since he did not knowingly acquire residence, he did not establish a Shabbat limit. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He has only four cubits total <b>and he is in the middle of them,</b> i.e., he has two cubits in each direction.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He may walk</b> four cubits <b>in any direction he wishes. But Rabbi Yehuda agrees that if he selected for himself</b> the direction in which he wants to walk those four cubits, <b>he cannot retract</b> and walk four cubits in a different direction.<br>With regard to a case where <b>there were two</b> people in this situation, positioned in such a way that <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> four <b>cubits of one were subsumed within the</b> four <b>cubits of the other, they may</b> each <b>bring</b> food <b>and eat</b> together in the shared area <b>in the middle,</b><br><br>Daf 45b<br><br><b>provided that the one does not carry</b> anything <b>from his</b> four-cubit limit <b>into that of his fellow.</b><br>With regard to a case where there <b>were three</b> people in this situation, <b>and</b> certain parts of the four cubits of <b>the middle one were subsumed within</b> the respective limits of each of <b>the others,</b> so that he shared a certain area with each of them, <b>he is permitted</b> to eat <b>with</b> either of <b>them, and they are</b> both <b>permitted</b> to eat <b>with him; but the two outer ones are forbidden</b> to eat <b>with each other,</b> since they share no common area.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this comparable?</b> It is like <b>three courtyards that open into one another, and</b> also <b>open into a public domain.</b> If <b>the two outer</b> courtyards <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with the middle one,</b> the middle one <b>is permitted to</b> carry to the two outer ones, <b>and they are permitted to</b> carry to <b>it, but the two outer</b> courtyards <b>are prohibited</b> to carry from <b>one to</b> the <b>other,</b> as they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with one another.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava raised a dilemma: What does Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri hold?</b> Does <b>he hold</b> that <b>ownerless objects acquire residence</b> for Shabbat, i.e., even an article that does not belong to anyone acquires residence at the onset of Shabbat and can therefore be carried two thousand cubits in each direction?<br><b>And</b> according to this understanding, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <b>should by right have disagreed</b> with the Rabbis even <b>about utensils</b> that were left in the field, i.e., that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, ownerless utensils can be moved two thousand cubits in each direction. <b>And the reason that they disagreed about a person</b> is <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the stringent ruling <b>of the Rabbis, that although there is</b> room <b>to say: Since</b> a person who is <b>awake acquires</b> for himself two thousand cubits, <b>he also acquires</b> them if he is <b>sleeping,</b> the mishna nonetheless <b>teaches us that</b> the Rabbis did <b>not</b> accept this argument, and this is why the dispute is taught specifically with respect to a person.<br><b>Or perhaps</b> we should understand his position differently, that <b>in general Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>ownerless objects do not acquire residence</b> of their own. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a person, <b>the reason is as follows: Since</b> a person who is <b>awake acquires</b> for himself two thousand cubits, <b>he also acquires</b> them if he is <b>sleeping.</b><br><b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rain that fell on the eve of a Festival has two thousand cubits in each direction,</b> meaning that one is permitted to carry the rainwater within a radius of two thousand cubits. But if the rain fell <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is like the feet of all people,</b> as it did not acquire residence, and consequently one is permitted to carry this water wherever he is permitted to walk.<br><b>Granted,</b> it is understandable <b>if you say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>ownerless objects acquire residence;</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Nuri, and consequently the rain that fell on the eve of the Festival acquired residence in the spot where it fell.<br><b>However, if you say</b> that he maintains that <b>ownerless objects do not acquire residence,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>Neither</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Nuri, <b>nor</b> that of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as it clearly indicates that rain acquires a place of residence even though it has no owner. Rather, we must say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri is of the opinion that ownerless objects acquire residence, and this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with his opinion.<br><b>Abaye sat and recited this tradition. Rav Safra said to Abaye: Perhaps we are dealing with rain</b> that fell <b>near a city, and the inhabitants of that city had it in mind,</b> and that is why it acquires two thousand cubits in each direction.<br>Abaye <b>said to him: It should not enter your mind</b> that such an understanding is correct, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A cistern that belongs to an individual,</b> its water is <b>like the feet of that individual,</b> the owner of the cistern, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk. <b>And</b> a cistern <b>that belongs to a particular city,</b> its water is <b>like the feet of</b> the people of <b>that city,</b> in that it may be carried wherever the inhabitants of that city may walk, i.e., two thousand cubits in each direction from the city. <b>And</b> a cistern <b>that belongs to pilgrims from Babylonia</b> on the way to Eretz Yisrael, meaning that it belongs to all Jews and has no particular owner, its water is <b>like the feet of the one who draws</b> the water, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk.<br><b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A cistern that belongs to</b> one of <b>the tribes</b> and has no particular owner, its water <b>has two thousand cubits in each direction.</b> If so, these two sources <b>contradict each other,</b> as the mishna teaches that water that belongs to the entire community does not establish residence, whereas the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that it may be carried two thousand cubits from its place.<br><b>Rather,</b> in order to resolve the contradiction, <b>learn from here: This</b> source, which states that the water may be carried two thousand cubits, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who says that even ownerless objects acquire residence; <b>that</b> source, which states that water that does not belong to any particular person is like the feet of the one who draws it, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that ownerless objects do not acquire residence.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>when</b> Abaye <b>came before Rav Yosef, he said to him: This is what Rav Safra said, and this is what I answered him.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: And why did you not answer him from the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself? If it should enter your mind that we are dealing with rain</b> that fell <b>near a city,</b> how can you understand the statement <b>that</b> the rainwater <b>has two thousand cubits in each direction?</b><br>According to your understanding, that the rainwater may be carried two thousand cubits because the inhabitants of the town had it in mind, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> said: The rainwater is <b>like the feet of the inhabitants of that city.</b> Rather, you must say that the inhabitants of the city did not acquire the water and that it may be carried within a radius of two thousand cubits, because the <i>baraita</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, that ownerless objects acquire residence.<br>The Gemara further examines the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>The Master said:</b> If rain fell <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is like the feet of all people.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And why</b> should this be? The water <b>should have acquired residence in the ocean [<i>okeyanos</i>],</b> where it was when the Festival began. And since the water went out on the Festival beyond its limit after it evaporated and formed into clouds, moving the water more than four cubits should be prohibited.<br><b>Let us say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> was taught <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. Because if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, he said: The entire world drinks from the waters of the ocean;</b> that is to say, evaporated ocean water is the source of rain.<br><b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Here we are dealing with clouds that were</b> already <b>formed on the eve of the Festival.</b> Since these clouds were already formed before the Festival, the water did not acquire residence in the ocean or travel beyond its limit on the Festival.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps those</b> clouds that had already been formed on the eve of the Festival <b>went</b> away, <b>and these</b> clouds, from which the rain fell, <b>are others</b> that did acquire residence in the ocean? The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <b>where there is</b> an identifying <b>sign</b> that these are the same clouds and not others.<br><b>And if you wish, say</b> that there is another reason we are not concerned that these might be other clouds: <b>This</b> matter of whether or not they are the same clouds pertains to <b>an uncertainty</b> with respect to <b>a rabbinic law,</b> and the principle is that with regard to <b>an uncertainty</b> concerning <b>a rabbinic law,</b> one may follow the <b>lenient</b> understanding.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Let</b> the water <b>acquire residence in the clouds,</b> where it was when the Festival began, and its limit should be measured from there. Since the <i>baraita</i> taught that the water is like the feet of all people, if so, <b>resolve from here</b> another dilemma, and say that <b>there is no</b> prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits above ten</b> handbreadths, and one is permitted to travel more than two thousand cubits above this height. <b>For if there is</b> a prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>let</b> the water <b>acquire residence in the clouds.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Actually,</b> I can <b>say to you: There is</b> a prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> even above ten handbreadths, <b>and the water</b> does not acquire residence in the clouds because it <b>is absorbed in the clouds.</b> Since water does not exist in its usual state within the clouds, but rather takes on a different form, it does not acquire residence there.<br><br></body></html>
