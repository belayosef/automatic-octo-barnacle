Daf 43a<br><br>for <b>they are</b> only <b>made to keep the water out;</b> that is to say, a boat’s walls are not designed to turn it into a place of residence, but to protect it from the water. Therefore, they do not have the status of partitions made for the purpose of residence.<br>The Gemara asks: As for <b>Rabba, what is the reason he did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to</b> a boat <b>that is moving, all agree,</b> i.e., even Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, that one is permitted to walk about the entire boat. <b>They disagree</b> only with regard to a boat <b>that is stationary.</b> Rabban Gamliel holds that the boat’s walls constitute effective partitions, whereas Rabbi Yehoshua disagrees.<br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The mishna is also precise</b> in its implication <b>that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>do not disagree with regard to a moving</b> boat. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this implied? <b>From that which is taught:</b> There was <b>an incident where</b> all of these Sages <b>were coming from Pelandarsin, and their boat set sail on the sea</b> on Shabbat, taking them out beyond their Shabbat limit. <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya walked</b> about <b>the entire</b> boat, while <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva did not move beyond four cubits, as they sought to be stringent with themselves.</b><br>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>they do not disagree with regard to a moving</b> boat, <b>that is why it is taught</b> that they <b>sought</b> to be stringent with themselves, i.e., they wished to practice stringency although they were under no obligation to do so, as they were concerned that <b>perhaps</b> the boat <b>will stand,</b> i.e., come to a stop.<br><b>But if you say</b> that <b>they disagree</b> even in the case of a boat that is moving, <b>this</b> phrase: <b>Sought to be stringent,</b> is problematic, for the mishna should not refer to a desire to be stringent, as according to their opinion <b>it is an</b> outright <b>prohibition.</b><br>With regard to the previous issue, <b>Rav Ashi said: The mishna is also precise,</b> implying this point in another manner as well, <b>for it teaches</b> the law governing a boat <b>parallel to</b> the law governing <b>a pen and a stable. Just as a pen and a stable are fixed</b> in their place, <b>so too,</b> the mishna discusses <b>a boat that is fixed</b> in its place.<br><b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> Rav and Shmuel both said that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel with regard to a boat,</b> and if they had to decide <b>the <i>halakha</i>,</b> then this proves <b>by inference that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagreed</b> about the issue. This is difficult, as the words: They wished to be stringent upon themselves, imply that there was no fundamental dispute at all.<br>Rav Ashi replied: <b>Yes,</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> do in fact disagree about a boat that is standing. When the mishna says that Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva wished to be stringent upon themselves, implying that there is no real dispute, it is referring to a boat that is stationary. <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, says: All that day</b> they spent on the boat, <b>they sat and discussed the matter of <i>halakha</i>;</b> and come <b>evening my father’s brother,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>determined:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a</b> moving <b>boat,</b> i.e., one is permitted to walk about all of it. <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva with regard to a pen and a stable,</b> i.e., one may only walk four cubits in them, and the same applies to a stationary boat.<br><b>Rav Ḥananya raised a dilemma: Does</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> apply <b>above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>or</b> perhaps does the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits not</b> apply <b>above ten</b> handbreadths? In other words, does the Shabbat limit apply only close to the ground, in which case walking more than ten handbreadths above the ground, would be permitted?<br>The Gemara clarifies the case in which this dilemma arises: With regard to <b>a post ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> partly within the limit and partly outside of it, this case <b>should not be a dilemma for you.</b> Such a stable post <b>is</b> like <b>solid ground,</b> although it differs from the surrounding area in height; therefore, it is prohibited to walk from the part within the limit to the part outside of it.<br>The case <b>where</b> there <b>should be a dilemma for you</b> is that of <b>a post ten</b> handbreadths <b>high but not four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> or the like. <b>Alternatively,</b> the case is one <b>where he advances by way of a leap</b> in the air above ten handbreadths from the ground.<br>The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of the previous dilemma: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a boat</b> sailing on the surface of the water more than ten handbreadths from the sea or river bed? Does the prohibition of Shabbat limits apply or not?<br><b>Rav Hoshaya said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from what was taught in the mishna: <b>It once happened that</b> all of these Sages <b>were coming from Pelandarsin, and their boat set sail on the sea, etc. Granted, if you say</b> that the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits applies</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>this is why</b> Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva <b>sought</b> to be stringent. <b>However, if you say</b> that the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> does not apply above ten handbreadths, <b>why did they seek</b> to be stringent?<br>The Gemara answers: It may be suggested <b>as Rava said</b> with regard to a parallel case, establishing that case as one where the boat was <b>moving through</b> shallow, <b>swampy water; here, too,</b> we are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the boat <b>was moving through</b> shallow, <b>swampy water,</b> within ten handbreadths of the sea’s bed, so that the prohibition of Shabbat limits certainly applies.<br>The Gemara cites another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the mishna: On <b>one occasion</b> on a Shabbat eve, <b>they did not enter the port until after nightfall, etc. Granted, if you say</b> that the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> applies above ten handbreadths, it was <b>well</b> that they asked whether or not they may disembark. <b>However, if you say</b> that the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits does not apply</b> above ten handbreadths, even if Rabban Gamliel had told them: <b>We were not within the</b> city’s <b>limit</b> before nightfall, <b>what</b> difference <b>would it</b> have made? They could have alighted from the boat, for the boat was above ten handbreadths, where the prohibition of Shabbat limits does not apply.<br>The Gemara answers that <b>Rava said:</b> The mishna refers to a case where the boat was <b>moving through</b> shallow, <b>swampy water</b> within ten handbreadths of the sea’s bed.<br>The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the incident involving <b>the seven teachings that were</b> first <b>said on Shabbat morning before Rav Ḥisda in Sura</b> and then repeated <b>toward the conclusion of</b> that <b>Shabbat before Rava in Pumbedita,</b> despite the fact that the distance between them is too great for someone to have traversed it on Shabbat.<br><b>Who said</b> those teachings, and delivered them from one place to the other? Was it <b>not Elijah</b> the Prophet, who traveled from Sura to Pumbedita by way of a miraculous leap through the air above ten handbreadths from the ground, <b>who said them? Apparently,</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits does not apply above ten</b> handbreadths, for Elijah would not have transgressed this prohibition. The Gemara rejects this argument: This is <b>no</b> proof; <b>perhaps Yosef the demon,</b> who does not observe Shabbat, <b>reported these</b> teachings and brought them from Sura to Pumbedita.<br>The Gemara attempts to bring a different proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who said: <b>I will be a nazirite on the day that the son of David comes,</b> i.e., upon the arrival of the Messiah, <b>he is permitted to drink wine on Shabbat and Festivals,</b> for the Messiah will not arrive on one of those days.<br><br>Daf 43b<br><br><b>However, he is prohibited to drink wine on all weekdays,</b> in case the Messiah has come and he has not yet been informed.<br>The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, if you say that</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits applies</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>that is</b> why <b>on Shabbat and Festivals he is permitted</b> to drink wine, for the Messiah will certainly not arrive from outside the Shabbat limit on those days. <b>But if you say that</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits does not apply</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>why is he permitted</b> to drink wine <b>on Shabbat and Festivals?</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse stated: “Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet,</b> before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers” (Malachi 3:23–24). This verse teaches that Elijah will arrive the day before the coming of the Messiah. <b>Since Elijah did not come the previous day,</b> the Messiah will not come today, and therefore he may drink.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If so, on weekdays, too, he should be permitted</b> to drink wine <b>each and every day, as Elijah did not arrive the previous day. Rather,</b> the reason for the prohibition on weekdays must be that <b>we say</b> that Elijah may already have <b>arrived at the Great Court,</b> but it has not yet become a matter of public knowledge. Likewise, <b>here too we should say</b> that Elijah already <b>arrived</b> the previous day <b>at the Great Court,</b> on the eve of Shabbat or a Festival.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>It has already been promised to the Jewish people that Elijah will not come either on the eve of Shabbat or on the eve of a Festival, due to the trouble,</b> lest people go out to greet him and not have time to complete all their preparations for the sacred day.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>It might enter your mind</b> to say that <b>since Elijah will not come</b> on Shabbat eve due to the trouble involved, the <b>Messiah will also not come</b> then, and if so, <b>on Shabbat eve he should</b> also <b>be permitted</b> to drink wine. However, this reasoning is rejected: It is only <b>Elijah</b> who <b>will not arrive</b> on Shabbat eve, but the <b>Messiah</b> himself <b>may arrive,</b> for <b>once the Messiah comes, all</b> the nations <b>will be subservient to the Jewish people,</b> and they will help them prepare whatever is needed for Shabbat.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>He should be permitted</b> to drink wine <b>on a Sunday,</b> for if Elijah cannot come on Shabbat, the Messiah will not come on a Sunday. <b>Let us resolve from here</b> that the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits does not apply</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>as if</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits applies</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>on Sunday he should be permitted</b> to drink wine, <b>as Elijah cannot come on Shabbat.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>tanna</i> was uncertain whether there is</b> a prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> above ten handbreadths <b>or</b> there is <b>no</b> prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits.</b> Therefore, he ruled <b>stringently</b> in this regard concerning Sunday.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>When did</b> the person who took the vow of naziriteship <b>arise</b> and <b>take</b> his <b>vow? If you say he arose</b> and took his vow <b>on a weekday, since</b> the vow of <b>naziriteship</b> already <b>took effect, how can Shabbat come and annul it?</b> Naziriteship cannot take effect one day and be annulled on the next; rather, once it applies, it remains in effect for the entire period of his vow.<br><b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>he arose on Shabbat and took</b> his <b>vow, or</b> else he arose <b>on a Festival and took</b> his <b>vow, and</b> it is only on <b>that day that he is permitted</b> to drink wine, as the Messiah will not come; but <b>from that day on he is prohibited</b> to drink wine, for once the naziriteship takes effect on a weekday, it remains in effect from that point onwards, even on Shabbat and Festivals.<br>It was taught in the mishna: On <b>one occasion, they did not enter the port</b> until after nightfall on Shabbat eve, and they asked Rabban Gamliel whether they were permitted to alight from the boat. He told them that they were permitted to alight, for he had been watching, and he knew that they had entered within the city’s limit before nightfall, and therefore they may walk throughout the city.<br>In order to clarify this issue, the Gemara cites that which was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel had a</b> special <b>tube through which he would look and see</b> a distance of <b>two thousand cubits on land, and</b> also determine <b>a corresponding</b> distance of <b>two thousand cubits at sea.</b><br>In general, <b>one who wishes to know the depth of a valley can bring</b> such <b>a tube and look through it, and he will know the depth of the valley.</b><br>The Gemara cites another statement with regard to measurements: <b>One who wishes to know the height of a palm tree,</b> but does not want to actually climb the tree to measure it, <b>can measure his</b> own <b>height, and</b> the length of <b>his</b> own <b>shadow, and</b> the length of <b>the shadow of the height</b> of the palm tree, and calculate the proportions, <b>and he will know the height of the palm tree.</b><br>The Gemara cites related advice: If, out of honor for the dead, <b>one wishes that a wild beast should not rest in the shade of a grave, he should insert a reed</b> into the ground <b>at</b> the end of <b>the fourth hour of the day,</b> roughly ten o’clock in the morning, when it is hot in the sun and cooler in the shade, and beasts begin to seek shelter in the shade. <b>And</b> he should <b>observe in which direction the shadow</b> of the reed <b>inclines,</b> and then <b>slant</b> the gravestone <b>upwards and downwards</b> until he finds an angle at which it casts no shadow at that hour, and the beasts will not come to rest at the grave during the heat of the day.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>Neḥemya, son of Rav Ḥanilai, was</b> once so <b>engrossed in</b> his <b>learning</b> that he did not notice that <b>he was going out beyond</b> his Shabbat limit. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Naḥman: Your student Neḥemya is in distress,</b> as he is outside the Shabbat limit and cannot enter. What can we do for him?<br>Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Establish a human partition for him,</b> i.e., people who are permitted to go out there should line up and form human walls, through which he is permitted to walk and thereby <b>reenter</b> the Shabbat limit.<br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak sat behind Rava, and Rava sat</b> in the first row <b>before Rav Naḥman. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What</b> precisely <b>was Rav Ḥisda’s dilemma</b> that he addressed to Rav Naḥman with regard to Neḥemya’s distress?<br>The Gemara explains: <b>If you say</b> that <b>we are dealing with</b> a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could be <b>filled with people</b> who had established an <i>eiruv</i> and were permitted to go out beyond the Shabbat limit and establish a human partition for Neḥemya, <b>and</b> then it can be argued that <b>the dilemma</b> that <b>he raised</b> was: Is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> that a person may walk throughout an enclosed area, although he had not established residence there before Shabbat while it was still day, and the same applies to a human partition of this kind;<br><br></body></html>
