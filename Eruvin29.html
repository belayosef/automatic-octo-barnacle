Daf 29a<br><br>The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring <b>to</b> a beet <b>that was</b> only <b>partially cooked,</b> which is dangerous.<br><b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna said: One may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with raw beets,</b> as <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Raw beet kills a healthy person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we see</b> people <b>eating it and they do not die?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a beet <b>that was</b> only <b>partially cooked,</b> which is dangerous.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda said: A cooked dish of beets is beneficial for the heart, good for the eyes, and all the more so</b> beneficial <b>for the intestines. Abaye said: That is</b> specifically when the dish <b>sits on the stove and makes a <i>tukh tukh</i></b> sound, i.e., it is cooked thoroughly enough to produce a boiling sound.<br><b>Rava</b> once <b>said</b> when he was in an especially good mood: <b>Behold, I am like</b> the intellectually sharp <b>ben Azzai,</b> who would regularly expound <b>in the markets of Tiberias.</b> I, too, am ready to answer any question posed to me. <b>One of the Sages said to Rava: How many apples</b> are needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? Rava <b>said to him: Does one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with apples?</b><br>The other Sage responded: <b>And</b> is it <b>not</b> permissible to establish an <i>eiruv</i> with them? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>All foods combine to disqualify the body</b> of a priest who eats <b>half of a half-loaf</b> of ritually impure food, <b>and</b> to complete the measure of <b>food</b> required for <b>two meals for</b> the purpose of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, and</b> to complete the measure of <b>an egg-bulk</b> required for a food to be able <b>to contract the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods?</b> An apple is a kind of food, so it should be included in the items that may be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the refutation? If you say</b> it is <b>because it was taught</b> using the term <b>all foods, and these</b> apples <b>are fit for eating,</b> how can an objection be raised from such a general term? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> already <b>say: One may not learn from general statements</b> using the word all, <b>even in a place where it says except,</b> since no rule exhausts all cases?<br><b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because it taught: And</b> all foods combine to complete the measure of <b>food</b> required for <b>two meals for</b> the purpose of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, and</b> to complete the measure of <b>an egg-bulk to contract the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods; and these</b> apples <b>are also susceptible to the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods.</b> Therefore, there is clear proof that the mishna is referring to apples as well.<br>Having established that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established with apples, the Gemara returns to the question raised above: <b>How many</b> apples are needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The minimum measure of <b>apples</b> that must be used for an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>a <i>kav</i>.</b><br>The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> When distributing poor man’s tithe, one must give each individual poor person at least <b>an <i>ukla</i>,</b> an eighth of a <i>log</i>, <b>of spices, a liter of vegetables, ten nuts, five peaches, two pomegranates,</b> or <b>one citron,</b> as these are worthy amounts for distribution. <b>And Gursak bar Darei said in the name of Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rav: And similarly,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> Now, it can be asked: <b>These</b> apples <b>should also be like peaches,</b> as they are similar in size, and it should be enough to use five apples for an <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara answers that there is a distinction between them: <b>These</b> peaches <b>are important,</b> and therefore five of them are a significant amount, <b>but these</b> apples <b>are not important,</b> and therefore one must use the larger measure of a <i>kav</i>.<br><b>Rav Yosef said: May his Master,</b> God, <b>forgive Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei,</b> for he erred and caused others to err. <b>I stated before him</b> a ruling in the name of Rav <b>concerning a mishna, and he stated it concerning the <i>baraita</i>,</b> which led to the error. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may not give a pauper</b> receiving poor man’s tithe <b>at the threshing floor less than half a <i>kav</i> of wheat or</b> less than <b>a <i>kav</i> of barley. Rabbi Meir says:</b> He must be given at least <b>half a <i>kav</i> of barley.</b> Similarly, he must be given no less than <b>a <i>kav</i> and a half of spelt, a <i>kav</i> of dried figs, or a <i>maneh</i> of pressed figs. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Not a <i>maneh</i>, but <b>half</b> a <i>maneh</i>. He must be given at least <b>half a <i>log</i> of wine. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Half that amount, <b>a quarter</b> <i>log</i>. <b>And</b> similarly, he must be given <b>a quarter</b> <i>log</i> <b>of oil. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Half that amount, <b>an eighth</b> of a <i>log</i>. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all other fruit, Abba Shaul said:</b> He must be given <b>enough to sell them and buy food</b> that suffices <b>for two meals with</b> the proceeds of <b>their</b> sale. <b>And</b> with regard to this mishna, <b>Rav said: And similarly,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>.</b><br>The Gemara poses a question with regard to Rav Yosef’s harsh reaction to Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei’s statement: <b>What is the strength of this over that?</b> The mishna and <i>baraita</i> seem to share the same content, so why should Rav’s ruling be more applicable to one than the other? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>spices was</b> also <b>taught in this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>and spices are not fit for eating</b> on their own but only when added as a flavoring to other foods, and therefore Rav could not have been referring to the <i>baraita</i> when he said that the same law applies to an <i>eiruv</i>; <b>wasn’t</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>wheat and barley taught here</b> in the mishna, <b>and they</b> too <b>are not</b> immediately <b>fit for eating</b> until they are processed further.<br><b>Rather, it is because it was taught</b> in the mishna that one must give <b>half a <i>log</i> of wine. And Rav said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of wine,</b> which is equal to half a <i>log</i>. <b>Since we require so much</b> wine, <b>learn from here</b> that <b>when Rav said: And similarly,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, he said it about this mishna</b> and the measures mentioned therein. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that this is the proper understanding of Rav’s statement.<br>The Gemara further examines the mishna cited earlier. <b>The Master said: And</b> all foods combine to complete the measure of <b>food</b> required <b>for two meals for</b> the purpose of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>. Rav Yosef thought to say</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may not be established <b>unless there is</b> a complete <b>meal of this</b> kind of food <b>and</b> a complete <b>meal of that</b> kind of food, meaning that an <i>eiruv</i> may only be established if each meal consists of a single type of food. <b>Rabba said to him:</b> An <i>eiruv</i> may be established with the amount of food required for two meals <b>even</b> if each type of food made up only <b>half, a third, or a quarter</b> of a meal.<br>The Gemara now examines Rav’s statement <b>itself,</b> which was cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Rav said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of wine.</b> The following question may be raised: <b>Do we</b> really <b>need so much? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The minimal amount of <b>wine</b> required for an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>enough to eat</b> bread <b>with it,</b> i.e., enough to soak the bread in to enable one to eat it? Additionally, the minimal amount of <b>vinegar</b> that may be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>enough to dip</b> the food <b>in it,</b> and the minimal amount of <b>olives and onions</b> is <b>enough to eat them</b> together with the bread. All of these quantities are calculated on the basis of <b>two meals.</b> This <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established with much less than two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of wine.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to cooked wine,</b> which is very strong, and therefore even a small amount suffices.<br><b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the minimal amount of <b>vinegar</b> that may be used for an <i>eiruv</i> <b>is enough to dip</b> food <b>in it. Rav Giddel said that Rav said: Enough to dip in it the food of two meals</b> consisting <b>of vegetables. Some say</b> that <b>Rav Giddel said that Rav said:</b> Enough to dip in it the <b>vegetables that are eaten in two</b> ordinary <b>meals,</b> which is less than the amount consumed in two meals consisting entirely of vegetables.<br><b>The Master</b> also <b>said</b> that the minimum measure of <b>olives and onions</b> that may be used for an <i>eiruv</i> is enough <b>to eat them</b> with <b>the food of two meals.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>May one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with onions? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir once spent Shabbat in</b> the town of <b>Ardiska, and a certain person came before him</b> and <b>said to him: Rabbi, I made an <i>eiruv</i></b> of Shabbat borders [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] <b>with onions,</b> so that I might walk to the town of <b>Tiv’in.</b> Ardiska was located between the man’s <i>eiruv</i> and his destination of Tiv’in, which was beyond his Shabbat limit as measured from his hometown. <b>And Rabbi Meir made him remain within his four cubits.</b> He forbade him to leave his four cubits, as he held that an <i>eiruv</i> made with onions is not an <i>eiruv</i>, and therefore the person had left his Shabbat limit without an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i>.<br>The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling, which states that onions may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, is referring <b>to</b> onion <b>leaves,</b> which are harmful; whereas <b>that</b> ruling, which states that onions may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, is referring <b>to</b> onion <b>bulbs,</b> which are edible. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>ate an onion and died early</b> the next morning, <b>we need not ask from what he died,</b> as his death was certainly caused by the onion. <b>And Shmuel said: They only taught</b> this <b>with regard to the leaves; but with regard to</b> onion <b>bulbs, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And even with regard to the leaves, we only stated</b> this concern<br><br>Daf 29b<br><br>in a case where the bulb <b>has not grown</b> to the size of <b>a span,</b> the distance between the thumb and the little finger of a hand that is spread apart, because at that stage the leaves are very toxic; <b>however, if it has grown</b> to the size of <b>a span, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b><br><b>Rav Pappa said: We only stated</b> this concern about eating onion leaves in a case where <b>one did not drink beer</b> afterward; <b>however, if he drank beer</b> afterward, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b><br><b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person should not eat onion because of</b> the <b>toxins in it. There was an incident with Rabbi Ḥanina, who ate half an onion and half of its toxins, and he fell deathly ill, and his colleagues prayed for mercy for him, and he survived.</b> He was rescued only <b>because the time needed him,</b> as his generation was in need of his teaching, but otherwise he would not have recovered.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira said that Shmuel said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with beer, and it invalidates a ritual bath with</b> a measure of <b>three <i>log</i>,</b> similar to drawn water. <b>Rav Kahana strongly objects to this:</b> This is <b>obvious, for what is the difference between this and dye-water? As we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Dye-water invalidates a ritual bath with</b> a measure of <b>three <i>log</i>,</b> like regular drawn water. <b>They said:</b> There is a difference between the two cases, as <b>there,</b> the liquid <b>is called dye-water; here, it is called beer.</b> Therefore, it might have been possible to argue that beer is not considered like water at all, in which case it would only invalidate a ritual bath if it changed the color of the water, and so Shmuel’s novel teaching was necessary.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> beer is needed to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, thought to say before Rav Yosef</b> as follows: <b>Two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of beer.</b> Rav Aḥa’s reasoning is now spelled out in detail. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If <b>one carries out wine</b> on Shabbat from a private domain to a public domain, he is liable if he carries out <b>enough</b> wine <b>for diluting a cup,</b> i.e., enough undiluted wine to fill a cup after it has been diluted with water. <b>And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught about</b> this mishna: <b>Enough</b> wine <b>for diluting a fine cup.</b> They inquired: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a fine cup?</b> They answered: <b>A cup of blessing. And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said: A cup of blessing must contain a quarter of a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of wine, <b>so that</b> after one <b>dilutes</b> the wine with water, <b>it amounts to a</b> full <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i>. <b>And</b> this measure is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rava</b> with regard to the strength of wine, <b>as Rava said: Any wine that is not</b> strong enough to require that it be <b>diluted</b> with <b>three</b> parts <b>water to one</b> part wine <b>is not</b> proper <b>wine.</b><br><b>And we learned in the latter clause</b> of the aforementioned mishna: <b>And</b> one is liable for carrying out <b>all other liquids, and</b> similarly <b>all waste water,</b> in the measure of <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>. Now, Rav Aḥa argues as follows: <b>Since there,</b> with respect to liability for carrying on Shabbat, the ratio is <b>one to four,</b> as one is liable for carrying out a quarter of a quarter-<i>log</i> of wine, and one is only liable for carrying out other liquids if one carries out a quarter-<i>log</i>; <b>here, too,</b> with respect to making an <i>eiruv</i>, the ratio of <b>one to four</b> should be maintained. Therefore, since Rav said that two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of wine are required for an <i>eiruv</i>, the minimum amount of beer one may use should be two full <i>log</i>.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>And this is not so. There,</b> with regard to carrying on Shabbat, we require four times as much beer as wine because <b>less than that</b> amount, i.e., less than a quarter-<i>log</i> of beer, <b>is insignificant. However, here,</b> with regard to establishing an <i>eiruv</i>, this is <b>not</b> relevant, <b>as it is common for people to drink a cup</b> of beer <b>in the morning and a cup</b> of beer <b>in the evening, and they rely on them</b> as their meals, as beer is satisfying even in such quantities. Therefore, we should require only two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of beer for an <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>How many dates</b> are needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The minimal amount of <b>dates</b> one may use is <b>a <i>kav</i>. Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one inadvertently <b>ate dried figs</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and paid dates</b> in compensation, <b>may a blessing come upon him.</b><br>The Gemara proceeds to clarify this ruling: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If you say</b> that one paid <b>according to the value</b> of the figs he ate, e.g., <b>he ate a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of figs <b>and he paid a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of dates, <b>what is</b> the reason it says: <b>May a blessing come upon him? He ate a <i>zuz</i> and paid a <i>zuz</i>. Rather, is it not</b> that he paid <b>in accordance with the measure</b> of the figs eaten, e.g., that <b>he ate a <i>se’a</i> of dried figs worth one <i>zuz</i>, and he paid a <i>se’a</i> of dates worth four</b> <i>zuz</i>. <b>And it says: May a blessing come upon him. Apparently, dates are superior</b> to dried figs. Accordingly, since we learned above that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with a <i>kav</i> of dried figs, a <i>kav</i> of dates should certainly suffice for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: No proof can be brought from here. It can be argued that <b>he actually ate a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of figs <b>and he paid a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of dates. <b>And what</b> is the reason it says: <b>May a blessing come upon him? For he ate something that buyers are not eager</b> to buy, <b>and he paid him something that buyers are eager</b> to buy. Even though they are equal in value, the priest benefits, for it is easier for him to sell dates than to sell dried figs.<br>With regard to <b><i>shetita</i>,</b> a dish made of roasted flour and honey, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Pineḥas said: Two large spoonfuls</b> are needed for an <i>eiruv</i>. With regard to <b><i>kisanei</i>,</b> a type of roasted grain, <b>Abaye said: Two Pumbeditan <i>bunei</i>,</b> the name of a particular of measurement.<br>Having mentioned roasted grain, the Gemara tangentially relates that <b>Abaye said: Mother,</b> actually his foster mother, <b>told me: These roasted grains are good for the heart and drive away</b> worrisome <b>thoughts.</b><br><b>And Abaye said: Mother told me</b> about another remedy. <b>One who suffers from weakness of the heart should</b> go and <b>bring the meat of the right thigh of a ram, and</b> also <b>bring the dung of grazing cattle from</b> the month of <b>Nisan, and if there is no cattle dung he should bring willow twigs, and</b> then <b>roast</b> the meat on a fire made with the dung or twigs, <b>and eat</b> it, <b>and drink afterward</b> some <b>diluted wine.</b> This will improve his condition.<br>Returning to the matter of quantities of food required for an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The minimum quantity for <b>anything that serves as a relish</b> is <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>with it,</b> i.e., enough to serve as a relish for the bread eaten in two meals. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>anything that is not a relish,</b> but rather is a food in its own right, one must use <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it.</b> The minimum quantity of <b>raw meat</b> is <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it. Roasted meat</b> is the subject of a dispute: <b>Rabba said: Enough to eat</b> the bread of two meals <b>with it.</b> That is to say, roasted meat is not a food in itself, but rather it serves as relish for other foods. <b>And Rav Yosef said: Enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it,</b> as it is a food in its own right.<br><b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>For these Persians eat pieces of</b> roasted <b>meat [<i>tabahakki</i>] without bread,</b> which shows that meat itself is a food. <b>Abaye said to him: But are the Persians a majority of the world?</b> The <i>halakha</i> follows the customary practice of most of the world and not that of particular locales. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> the following in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>Clothing of the poor,</b> i.e., pieces of cloth measuring three by three fingerbreadths, contracts impurity when in the possession of any <b>poor people</b> because poor people attach importance even to scraps of cloth of such small size. <b>Clothing of the wealthy</b> measuring at least three by three handbreadths contracts impurity in all cases, whether or not it is owned by <b>the wealthy.</b><br><br></body></html>
