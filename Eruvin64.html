Daf 64a<br><br><b>If so, you have abolished</b> the halakhic <b>category of <i>eiruv</i> from that alleyway.</b> Since from a halakhic perspective it is considered as though only one person lives in that alleyway, there is no need for an <i>eiruv</i>. Consequently, when the residents carry in it without an <i>eiruv</i>, observers will mistakenly think that it is permitted to carry in an alleyway even without an <i>eiruv</i>.<br>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, replied: It is required <b>that they establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> anyway, as a reminder of the laws of <i>eiruvin</i>, even though it serves no halakhic purpose. Rava retorted that this in turn results in a different problem: Observers will then <b>say</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> is effective</b> even <b>in the place of a gentile,</b> even if he does not rent out his domain, which is against the <i>halakha</i>. He replied: <b>We make an announcement</b> to the effect that they are not carrying because of the <i>eiruv</i>, and that it only serves as a reminder.<br>Rava rejected this option as well: Can we make <b>an announcement for the children?</b> Even if it is assured that all adults present will hear the announcement, how will the children, who do not hear or understand the announcement, know the <i>halakha</i> later in life? Recalling that their fathers established an <i>eiruv</i> in this alleyway, they will think that an <i>eiruv</i> is effective even in the place of a gentile. Therefore, one cannot rely on Abaye’s solution.<br><b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the gentile’s Jewish neighbors should proceed as follows: <b>Let one of them go and become friendly with</b> the gentile, <b>and ask him</b> for permission to make use of <b>a place</b> in his domain, <b>and set something down there, thus becoming like</b> the gentile’s <b>hired laborer or harvester. And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Not only can the gentile himself rent out his domain for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>, but <b>even his hired laborer, and even his harvester,</b> if he is a Jew, <b>may</b> rent out the space and <b>contribute to the <i>eiruv</i></b> on his behalf, <b>and this is enough.</b><br><b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: If there were five hired laborers or five harvesters there, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the presence of more than one of these, if they are all Jews, entail a stringency, such that they are all required to join in the <i>eiruv</i> or that they are all required to rent out his domain? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: If</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that the gentile’s <b>hired laborer or harvester</b> stands in his place <b>as a leniency, would they say that his hired laborer or harvester</b> stands in his place <b>as a stringency?</b> This law was stated only as a leniency with regard to the laws of renting for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>, not in order to introduce more stringencies.<br>The Gemara proceeds to examine the ruling cited in the course of the previous discussion. Returning to <b>the matter itself, Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Even</b> the gentile’s <b>hired laborer, and even his harvester, may contribute to the <i>eiruv</i></b> in his stead, <b>and this is enough. Rav Naḥman said: How excellent is this <i>halakha</i>.</b> Even Rav Naḥman agreed with this statement, and viewed it as correct and substantiated.<br>However, Rav Naḥman did not give his approval to all of Rav Yehuda’s rulings, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If one drank a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of wine, he may not issue a</b> halakhic <b>ruling,</b> as the wine is liable to confuse his thinking. With regard to this second statement, <b>Rav Naḥman said: This <i>halakha</i> is not excellent, as</b> concerning <b>myself, as long as I have not drunk a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of wine, my mind is not clear.</b> It is only after drinking wine that I can issue appropriate rulings.<br><b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master said this,</b> making a statement that praises one <i>halakha</i> and disparages another? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina say: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But he who keeps company with prostitutes</b> [<b><i>zonot</i></b>] <b>wastes his fortune”</b> (Proverbs 29:3)? It alludes to the following: <b>Anyone who says: This teaching is pleasant</b> [<b><i>zo na’a</i></b>] <b>but this is not pleasant, loses the fortune of Torah.</b> It is not in keeping with the honor of Torah to make such evaluations. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I retract,</b> and I will no longer make such comments concerning words of Torah.<br>On the topic of drinking wine, <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: One who has drunk</b> wine <b>must not pray, but if he</b> nonetheless <b>prayed, his prayer is a prayer,</b> i.e., he has fulfilled his obligation. On the other hand, <b>one who is intoxicated</b> with wine <b>must not pray, and if he prayed, his prayer is an abomination.</b><br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which a person is considered <b>one who has drunk</b> wine; <b>and what are the circumstances</b> in which a person is considered <b>one who is intoxicated</b> with wine? The Gemara answers that one can learn this from <b>the following</b> event: <b>As Rabbi Abba bar Shumni and Rav Menashya bar Yirmeya from Gifti were taking leave of each other at the ford of the Yofti River, they said: Let each one of us say something that his fellow</b> scholar <b>has not</b> yet <b>heard, for Mari bar Rav Huna said: A person must take leave of his fellow only in the midst of</b> a discussion of <b>a matter of <i>halakha</i>, as due to this he will remember him.</b><br><b>One</b> of them <b>opened</b> the discussion <b>and said: What are the circumstances</b> where a person is considered <b>one who has drunk</b> wine, <b>and what are the circumstances</b> where a person is considered <b>one who is intoxicated</b> with wine? <b>One who has drunk</b> wine refers to <b>anyone</b> who has drunk wine but whose mind remains clear enough <b>that he is able to talk in the presence of a king. One who is intoxicated</b> refers to <b>anyone</b> who is so disoriented by the wine he has drunk <b>that he is not able to talk in the presence of a king.</b><br><b>The other one</b> then <b>opened</b> a different discussion <b>and said:</b> With regard to <b>one who took possession of a convert’s property, what should he do so that it remains in his hands?</b> The property of a convert who died without children is regarded as ownerless, and is acquired by the first person to perform a valid act of acquisition upon it. Since in this case the one who took possession of the property did not acquire it through his own labor, his ownership is tenuous, and he is liable to lose it unless he uses it for the purpose of a mitzva. One in this situation <b>should buy a Torah scroll with</b> part of the revenue, and by the merit of this act, he will retain the rest. <b>Rav Sheshet said: Even</b><br><br>Daf 64b<br><br><b>a husband</b> who acquired rights <b>to his wife’s property</b> that she had brought into the marriage as her dowry should use part of the profits for the acquisition of a Torah scroll.<br><b>Rava said: Even if he entered into a business venture and made a</b> large <b>profit,</b> he should act in a similar manner. <b>Rav Pappa said: Even if he found a lost article,</b> he should do the same. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> He need not use the money to commission the writing of a Torah scroll, as <b>even if</b> he <b>wrote</b> a set of <b>phylacteries with it,</b> this, too, is a mitzva whose merit will enable him to retain the rest of the money.<br><b>Rav Ḥanin said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> who said: <b>What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>As it is written: “And Israel vowed a vow</b> to the Lord and said: If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will consecrate their cities” (Numbers 21:2), which shows that one who wishes to succeed should sanctify a portion of his earnings for Heaven.<br>The Gemara now cites additional teachings relating to the drinking of wine. <b>Rami bar Abba said:</b> Walking a <b>path of a <i>mil</i>, and</b> similarly, <b>sleeping</b> even <b>a minimal amount,</b> will <b>dispel the</b> effect of <b>wine</b> that one has drunk. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: They only taught</b> this with regard to one <b>who has drunk a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of wine, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>one who has drunk more than a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, this advice is not useful. In that case, walking a <b>path</b> of such a distance <b>will preoccupy</b> and exhaust <b>him all the more, and</b> a small amount <b>of sleep will</b> further <b>intoxicate him.</b><br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>Does</b> walking <b>a path of</b> only <b>a <i>mil</i> dispel the</b> effects of <b>wine? Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was an incident involving Rabban Gamliel, who was riding a donkey and traveling from Akko to Keziv, and</b> his student <b>Rabbi Elai was walking behind him.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>found</b> some <b>fine loaves</b> of bread <b>on the road, and he said to</b> his student: <b>Elai, take the loaves from the road.</b> Further along the way, Rabban Gamliel <b>encountered a certain gentile</b> and <b>said to him: Mavgai, take these loaves from Elai.</b><br><b>Elai joined</b> the gentile <b>and said to him: Where are you from?</b> He <b>said to him: From the</b> nearby <b>towns of guardsmen.</b> He asked: <b>And what is your name?</b> The gentile replied: <b>My name is Mavgai.</b> He then inquired: <b>Has Rabban Gamliel ever met you before,</b> seeing as he knows your name? He <b>said to him: No.</b><br>The Gemara interrupts the story in order to comment: <b>At that time we learned that Rabban Gamliel divined</b> the gentile’s name <b>by way of divine inspiration</b> that rested upon him. <b>And at that time we</b> also <b>learned three matters</b> of <i>halakha</i> from Rabban Gamliel’s behavior: <b>We learned that one may not pass by food,</b> i.e., if a person sees food lying on the ground, he must stop and pick it up.<br><b>We</b> also <b>learned that we follow the majority of travelers.</b> Since the area was populated mostly by gentiles, Rabban Gamliel assumed that the loaf belonged to a gentile, and was consequently prohibited to be eaten by a Jew. Therefore, he ordered that it be given to a gentile. And <b>we</b> further <b>learned that</b> with regard to <b>leavened bread belonging to a gentile, it is permitted</b> to <b>benefit</b> from this food <b>after Passover.</b> The incident recounted above occurred not long after the festival of Passover. By giving the loaf to the gentile instead of burning it in accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> of leavened bread that remains after Passover, Rabban Gamliel gained a certain benefit from it in the form of the gentile’s gratitude. This benefit is regarded as having monetary value.<br>The Gemara resumes the narrative: <b>When</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>arrived in Keziv, a</b> person <b>came</b> before him <b>to request</b> that he dissolve <b>his vow.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to the one who was with him,</b> i.e., Rabbi Elai: <b>Did we drink a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of Italian wine</b> earlier? He <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rabban Gamliel replied: <b>If so, let him journey after us until</b> the effect of <b>our wine is dispelled,</b> after which we may consider his issue.<br><b>And</b> that person <b>journeyed after them</b> for <b>three <i>mil</i>, until</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>arrived at the Ladder of Tyre. When he arrived at the Ladder of Tyre, Rabban Gamliel alighted from his donkey and wrapped himself</b> in his shawl in the customary manner of a judge, who wraps himself in a shawl in order to sit in awe at the time of judgment, <b>and he sat and dissolved his vow.</b><br>The Gemara continues: <b>At that time we learned many matters</b> of <i>halakha</i> from Rabban Gamliel’s conduct. <b>We learned that a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of Italian wine intoxicates, and we learned</b> that <b>one who is intoxicated may not issue a</b> halakhic <b>ruling, and we learned that</b> walking on <b>a path dispels</b> the effect <b>of wine, and</b> lastly <b>we learned that one may not annul vows</b> when he is <b>either mounted</b> on an animal, <b>or walking, or</b> even <b>standing, but</b> only when he is <b>sitting.</b><br><b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that Rabban Gamliel found it necessary to walk <b>three <i>mil</i></b> in order to become sober after drinking wine. The Gemara resolves the contradiction. <b>Italian wine is different</b> in that <b>it is more intoxicating,</b> therefore more extended activity is required in order to dispel its effects.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>But didn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to one <b>who has drunk a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of wine, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>one who has drunk more than a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, <b>walking</b> that distance <b>will preoccupy</b> and exhaust <b>him all the more, and</b> a small amount of <b>sleep will</b> further <b>intoxicate him?</b> If Italian wine is more intoxicating than other wine, shouldn’t a quarter-<i>log</i> be considered like a larger quantity of other wine?<br>The Gemara answers: Being <b>mounted</b> on an animal <b>is different</b> from walking; since he is not on foot it is not such a tiring activity. Accordingly, riding three <i>mil</i> will not exhaust him; rather, it will dispel the effect of the wine. The Gemara adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> conclusion, <b>according to Rami bar Abba,</b> who says that walking one <i>mil</i> is sufficient, <b>it is also not difficult,</b> as he too can say that <b>riding is different</b> from walking. Since one is not on foot, the effects of the wine are not dispelled as quickly. Therefore, three <i>mil</i> is necessary.<br>The Gemara poses a question with regard to one of the details of the story: <b>Is that so,</b> that Rabban Gamliel was required to alight from his donkey in order to annul the vow? <b>But didn’t Rav Naḥman say: One may annul vows walking, standing, or mounted?</b> Why, then, did Rabban Gamliel dismount his donkey?<br>The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as there is</b> an authority <b>who says</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>open</b> the possibility for dissolution of a vow <b>by means of regret</b> alone. In other words, there is no need to search for a special reason in order to dissolve a person’s vow; it is enough to ascertain that he regrets making it. This can be done easily, even while walking, standing, or riding.<br><b>And there is</b> another authority <b>who says</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not open</b> the possibility for dissolution of a vow <b>by means of regret</b> alone. Rather, one must find an opening, i.e., a particular reason to dissolve the vow in question, which requires a thorough analysis of the circumstances of the vow. This task must be performed free of distractions, which means one must be seated (<i>Tosafot</i>).<br><b>As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With <b>what did Rabban Gamliel open</b> the possibility for dissolving his vow <b>for that man,</b> i.e., what opening did he find for him? Rabban Gamliel cited the verse: <b>“There is one who utters like the piercings of a sword; but the tongue of the wise is health”</b> (Proverbs 12:18) and explained it as follows: <b>Whoever utters</b> a vow <b>deserves to be pierced by a sword,</b> as he might fail to fulfill it. Therefore, one should not vow at all. Had you known that whoever vows is liable to be executed, would you have vowed? <b>Rather, it is the tongue of the wise that heals,</b> as when a Sage dissolves a vow, he dissolves it retroactively, and it is as though one had never taken the vow.<br>The Gemara continues with its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> previously: One of the <i>halakhot</i> learned from the incident involving Rabban Gamliel was that <b>one may not pass by food;</b> rather, one must treat the food with respect and pick it up. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai: They taught</b> this ruling <b>only in the early generations, when Jewish women were not accustomed to using witchcraft. However, in the later generations, when Jewish women are accustomed to using witchcraft, one may pass by</b> food, as a spell might have been cast on the bread, and one must not put himself in unnecessary danger.<br>A Sage <b>taught:</b> If the loaves are <b>whole, one</b> may <b>pass</b> them <b>by,</b> as they might have been placed there for the purposes of witchcraft; however, if they are in <b>pieces, one</b> may <b>not pass</b> them <b>by,</b> because bread in pieces is not used for witchcraft. <b>Rav Asi said to Rav Ashi:</b> Do <b>they not perform</b> magic with <b>pieces</b> of bread? <b>Isn’t it written</b> in the verse that deals with witchcraft: <b>“And you have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread”</b> (Ezekiel 13:19)? The Gemara answers: The verse does not mean that they used pieces of bread in their witchcraft, but rather that <b>they took</b> such pieces <b>as their wages.</b><br><b>Rav Sheshet said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya:</b><br><br></body></html>
