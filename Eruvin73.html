Daf 73a<br><br><b>The place</b> where he eats his <b>bread, and Shmuel said:</b> His <b>place</b> of <b>sleep.</b><br>The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>shepherds; fig watchmen,</b> who guard figs spread out in the field; <b>guardsmen</b> who sit in small guardhouses; <b>and produce watchmen; when they customarily sleep in the city</b> in addition to eating there, <b>they are like the residents of the city</b> with regard to their Shabbat limit, even though they were in the field when Shabbat began. However, <b>when they customarily sleep in the field,</b> even though they eat in the town, <b>they have</b> only <b>two thousand</b> cubits <b>in each direction</b> from the places where they sleep. This seems to contradict the opinion of Rav, who maintains that a person’s place of dwelling is determined by where he eats, not by where he sleeps.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the people in the field, <b>we are witnesses,</b> i.e., it is clearly evident, <b>that if</b> people would <b>bring them bread there,</b> to the place where they sleep, <b>it would be more convenient for them.</b> Fundamentally, however, a person’s dwelling place is determined by where he eats, rather than where he sleeps.<br><b>Rav Yosef said: I have not heard this <i>halakha</i></b> stated by Rav. An illness had caused Rav Yosef to forget his studies. His student, <b>Abaye, said to him: You</b> yourself <b>said it to us, and it was with regard to this that you said it to us:</b> With regard to <b>brothers who were eating at their father’s table and sleeping in their</b> own <b>houses</b> in the same courtyard, a separate contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i> is required for each and every one</b> of them. <b>And we said to you:</b> Can one <b>learn from</b> here that a person’s <b>place of sleep determines</b> the location of his Shabbat residence? <b>And you said to us in this regard</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: They taught</b> this mishna <b>with regard to</b> brothers <b>who receive a portion</b> from their father and are therefore considered as though they eat at his table, whereas in actual fact they eat their meals in their own homes.<br><b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who has five wives</b> who <b>receive a portion from their husband</b> while each living in her own quarters in the courtyard, <b>and five slaves</b> who <b>receive a portion from their master</b> while living in their own lodgings in the courtyard, <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira permits in</b> the case of <b>the wives,</b> i.e., they do not each have to contribute separately to the <i>eiruv</i>, as they are all considered to be residing with their husband. <b>And he prohibits in</b> the case of <b>the slaves,</b> meaning that he holds that as they live in separate houses, each is considered as residing on his own.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava permits in</b> the case of <b>the slaves,</b> as a slave necessarily follows his master, <b>and he prohibits in</b> the case of <b>the wives,</b> as each woman is significant in her own right, and is not totally dependent on her husband.<br><b>Rav said: What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava? As it is written: “But Daniel was in the gate of the king”</b> (Daniel 2:49). The verse refers to Daniel’s function rather than to an actual location, indicating that wherever Daniel went, it was as though he was in the king’s gate. The same applies to any slave vis-à-vis his master.<br>The Gemara proceeds to clarify various aspects of this issue, starting with a summary of what has already been stated. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious</b> in the case of <b>a son with his father, as we stated</b> it above the mishna. <b>A wife with her husband and a slave with his master</b> are subject to the <b>dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava.</b> With regard to <b>a student</b> who lives <b>with his master</b> in the same courtyard and receives his sustenance from him, <b>what</b> is his status with regard to <i>eiruv</i>?<br><b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this question: <b>As Rav,</b> when he was <b>in the school of Rabbi Ḥiyya, said: We do not need to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, as we are dependent upon the table of Rabbi Ḥiyya. And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> himself, when he was <b>in the school of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said: We do not need to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, as we are dependent upon the table of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.<br><b>Abaye raised a dilemma before Rabba:</b> With regard to <b>five</b> people <b>who</b> live in the same courtyard and <b>collected their <i>eiruv</i>, when they take their <i>eiruv</i> elsewhere</b> in order to merge their courtyard with a different one, is <b>one</b> contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> sufficient <b>for all of them, or do they need</b> a separate contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i> for each and every one</b> of them? Rabba <b>said to him: One</b> contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> suffices <b>for all of them.</b><br>Abaye asked: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>brothers, who are comparable</b> to people <b>who collected</b> their <i>eiruv</i>, the mishna nonetheless <b>teaches: They require a</b> separate <b><i>eiruv</i> for each and every one</b> of them. Rabba responded: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where there are</b> other <b>residents,</b> in addition to the father and his sons, living <b>with them.</b> In that case, <b>since these</b> additional residents <b>render</b> carrying in the same courtyard <b>prohibited</b> unless they join in an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>those</b> brothers <b>also render it prohibited</b> for one another to carry in the other courtyard unless each of them contributes to the <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches: When</b> do they state this <i>halakha</i>? <b>When they bring their <i>eiruv</i> elsewhere</b> in the courtyard. <b>But if their <i>eiruv</i> was coming to them, or if there are no</b> other <b>residents with them in the courtyard, they do not need to establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> as they are considered like a single individual living in a courtyard. <b>Learn from this</b> that the preceding ruling refers to a situation where they shared the courtyard with other residents.<br>The Gemara addresses a similar issue with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries: <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> With regard to <b>students in their master’s house who eat</b> their <b>bread in</b> their houses <b>in the field [<i>baga</i>] and</b> then <b>come and sleep in</b> their <b>master’s house, when we measure</b> their Shabbat <b>limit for them, do we measure</b> it <b>for them from</b> their <b>master’s house,</b> where they sleep, <b>or do we measure</b> it <b>for them from the field,</b> where they eat? <b>He said to him: We measure</b> it <b>from</b> their <b>master’s house.</b><br>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin asked: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who deposits his <i>eiruv</i>,</b> which establishes the location of his meal, <b>within two thousand cubits, and</b> then <b>goes</b> back <b>and sleeps in his house, we measure his</b> Shabbat <b>limit from his <i>eiruv</i>.</b> This implies that the determining factor is where he eats, rather than where he sleeps.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>In that</b> case <b>we are witnesses, and in this</b> case <b>we are witnesses,</b> i.e., in both cases the person’s intentions regarding his place of residence are clearly evident. <b>In that</b> case, where the person deposits his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>we are witnesses that if he</b> could <b>reside there,</b> at the site of his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it would be better for him,</b> i.e., if he could spend the night there he would do so, since he wishes to continue from that place onward on the following day. <b>And in this</b> case of the students in their master’s house, <b>we are witnesses that if</b> people <b>would bring them bread in their master’s house,</b> enabling them to eat there, <b>it would be better for them.</b> Consequently, it is considered their place of residence.<br><b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda:</b> With regard to <b>a father and his son,</b> or <b>a master and his student, are they considered as many</b> people <b>or as individuals?</b> The practical import of the question is as follows: If they lived together in a courtyard that was within another courtyard, are they considered as many people, who <b>require an <i>eiruv</i></b> in order to render it permitted to carry in the outer courtyard, <b>or do they not require an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> as they are treated as an individual, who does not render carrying in the outer courtyard prohibited? Is <b>their alleyway</b> rendered <b>permitted</b> for carrying <b>through a side post and</b> a cross <b>beam,</b> like one that has multiple residents, <b>or is it not</b> rendered <b>permitted</b> for carrying <b>through a side post and</b> a cross <b>beam?</b><br>Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: You have</b> already <b>learned this</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a father and his son</b> or <b>a master and his student, when there are no</b> other <b>residents with them, they are</b> considered <b>like individuals, and they do not need to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, and their alleyway</b> becomes <b>permitted</b> for carrying <b>through a side post and</b> a cross <b>beam</b> without a merging of alleyways.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>five courtyards open into one another and</b> also <b>open into an alleyway,</b> the following distinctions apply: If the residents of the courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> in the courtyards and did not merge the</b> courtyards that open into the <b>alleyway, they are permitted</b> to carry <b>in the courtyards and they are prohibited</b> to carry <b>in the alleyway.</b> The <i>eiruv</i> they established cannot also serve as a merging of the courtyards that open into the alleyway.<br><br>Daf 73b<br><br><b>And if they merged</b> the courtyards of <b>the alleyway, they are permitted</b> to carry both <b>here,</b> in the alleyway, and <b>there,</b> in the courtyards.<br>If <b>they established an <i>eiruv</i> in the courtyards</b> and also <b>merged</b> the courtyards of <b>the alleyway, and one of the residents of the courtyard forgot and did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> in his courtyard, but did participate in the merging of the courtyards in the alleyway, <b>they are permitted</b> both <b>here and there,</b> as the merging of courtyards in the alleyway serves as an effective <i>eiruv</i> for the courtyards as well.<br>However, if one <b>of the residents of the alleyway</b> forgot <b>and did not</b> participate in the <b>merging</b> of courtyards that open into the alleyway, <b>they are permitted</b> to carry <b>in the courtyards and prohibited</b> from carrying <b>in the alleyway, as</b> the principle is: <b>An alleyway is to</b> its <b>courtyards as a courtyard is to</b> its <b>houses.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: We require an <i>eiruv</i> and we</b> also <b>require a merging</b> of the courtyards in an alleyway, and one is not sufficient without the other.<br>The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say</b> the <b>middle clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And if they merged</b> the courtyards <b>in the alleyway, they are permitted</b> to carry both <b>here and there. We have arrived at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>one is enough,</b> and one does not need both an <i>eiruv</i> and a merging of alleyways.<br>The Gemara responds: <b>That is not difficult,</b> as the mishna <b>stated</b> as follows: <b>And if they also merged</b> the courtyards in the alleyway, they are permitted to carry in the courtyards and in the alleyway.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>they established an <i>eiruv</i> in the courtyards and</b> also <b>merged</b> the courtyards <b>in the alleyway, and one of the residents of the courtyard forgot and did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> in his courtyard but did participate in the merging of the alleyway, <b>they are permitted</b> to carry both <b>here and there. What are the circumstances? If</b> the person who forgot <b>did not renounce</b> his rights to the courtyard in favor of the others, <b>why are they permitted</b> to carry? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious that he did renounce</b> those rights. But if so, <b>say the last clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>one of the members of the alleyway forgot and did not</b> participate in the <b>merging</b> of the alleyway, <b>they are permitted</b> to carry <b>in the courtyards and prohibited</b> from carrying <b>in the alleyway. But if he renounced</b> his rights, <b>why are they prohibited</b> from carrying <b>in the alleyway?</b><br><b>And if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>renunciation of rights is not</b> effective <b>in an alleyway,</b> that answer is insufficient. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to an alleyway: <b>As he renounced his rights in your favor;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir?</b> This indicates that Rabbi Meir accepts the principle of renunciation of rights in an alleyway.<br><b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the person who forgot to participate in the merging of alleyways <b>did not renounce</b> his rights. <b>And from the</b> fact that <b>the last clause</b> of the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he did not renounce</b> his rights, it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> is <b>also</b> referring to a case <b>where he did not renounce</b> his rights. This would indicate that if they carried out a merging of alleyways, it also serves as an <i>eiruv</i>, even when one of them forgot to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i> and also failed to renounce his rights in the courtyard. This is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, which leads to the puzzling conclusion that the <b>first and last clauses</b> of the mishna are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> while the <b>middle clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b><br>The Gemara answers: In fact, <b>it is all</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir said we require an <i>eiruv</i> and we</b> also <b>require a merging</b> of alleyways? It was only so <b>as not to cause the</b> halakhic <b>category of <i>eiruv</i> to be forgotten by the children.</b> If people would only merge courtyards, the <i>halakha</i> of establishing an <i>eiruv</i> for a courtyard would gradually be forgotten. <b>And here,</b> where only one person forgot to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>, <b>since most of</b> them <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the courtyards, the <i>halakha</i> of an <i>eiruv</i> <b>will not be forgotten.</b> Therefore, there is room to be lenient after the fact and to permit carrying in both places.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said: Rav did not teach</b> the mishna as stating that the five courtyards <b>open into one another,</b> but rather that each courtyard opens into the alleyway, and each established its own <i>eiruv</i>. <b>And so too, Rav Kahana said: Rav did not teach</b> the mishna as stating that the courtyards <b>open into one another. Some say</b> that <b>Rav Kahana himself did not teach</b> the mishna as stating that the courtyards <b>open into one another.</b><br><b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What is the reason he did not teach</b> the mishna as stating that the five courtyards <b>open into one another?</b> Rav Yosef replied: Because <b>he holds</b> that <b>any merging</b> of alleyways <b>that is not brought in and taken out by way of the entrances</b> that open <b>into the alleyway,</b> i.e., which is not brought from each courtyard into the alleyway and then taken from the alleyway into the courtyard where it will be deposited, <b>is not considered</b> a valid <b>merging</b> of the alleyway. If the food used for the merging of alleyways is transferred directly from one courtyard to another, it seems as though it is being used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>. It is therefore ineffective as a merging of alleyways. Here too, if the courtyards open into one another, the merging of alleyways is invalid, due to a concern that the residents of the courtyard will transfer the food directly from one courtyard to another.<br><b>He raised an objection to him</b> based upon the following mishna: <b>A homeowner who was a partner of his neighbors, with this one in wine and with that one in wine, they do not need to establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> This indicates that it is not actually necessary to transfer the food used for the merging of alleyways from one place to another. For example, it is sufficient to have a jointly owned barrel of wine in one courtyard even if it did not pass through the alleyway. The Gemara rejects this proof and explains the mishna as follows: <b>There,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where they took</b> the wine <b>out</b> into the alleyway and subsequently <b>brought it in</b> to the courtyard where it was to be kept.<br><b>He raised</b> another <b>objection to him</b> from a different mishna: <b>How does one merge</b> courtyards that open <b>into alleyways?</b> The mishna continues and says that it is sufficient for one person to acquire the food used for the merging on behalf of all the other residents of the alleyway. This indicates that the food does not need to pass through all the courtyards in the alleyway. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>There too,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where they</b> first <b>took</b> the food <b>out</b> from each of the courtyards into the alleyway <b>and</b> from there <b>brought it into</b> the courtyard where it was to be deposited.<br><b>Rabba bar Ḥanan strongly objects to this: However, if</b> that <b>is so,</b> if <b>he transferred ownership of bread in his basket to</b> another person, <b>so too, it would not be</b> considered a valid <b>merging. And if you say</b> that <b>this is</b> indeed <b>so, didn’t Rav Yehuda say that Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>members of a group who were dining</b> together on Shabbat eve, <b>and the day became sanctified for them,</b> i.e., Shabbat began while they were eating, <b>they may rely upon the bread on the table as an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the courtyard, <b>and some say, as a merging</b> of the alleyway.<br><b>And Rabba said:</b> The two versions <b>do not disagree</b> with each other regarding whether the bread counts as an <i>eiruv</i> or as a merging of the alleyway. <b>Here,</b> where they can use it as an <i>eiruv</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where they were dining in a house,</b> since food deposited inside a house can serve as an <i>eiruv</i> for the courtyard. <b>There,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where they were dining in a courtyard,</b> and therefore they may rely on the bread as a merging of the alleyway. This proves that even Rav agrees that it is not necessary to take the food used to merge an alleyway into the alleyway itself and then bring it back to the courtyard.<br><b>Rather,</b> we must retract the previous explanation and say that <b>the reason Rav</b> did not teach the mishna as stating that the courtyards opened into one another is <b>that he holds</b> that <b>an alleyway cannot</b> be <b>rendered permitted</b> for carrying <b>through a side post and</b> a cross <b>beam unless there are houses and courtyards opening into it.</b> If, however, the courtyards open into one another, they are considered like a single courtyard, in which case they cannot be rendered permitted for carrying through a side post or a cross beam, and the merging of the alleyway is ineffective.<br>The Gemara now examines <b>the matter itself</b> cited in the previous discussion. <b>Rav said: An alleyway cannot</b> become <b>permitted</b> for carrying <b>through a side post and</b> a cross <b>beam,</b><br><br></body></html>
