Daf 21a<br><br><b>must climb up</b> and <b>climb down</b> into the well, and drink there.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so?</b> Is the allowance of upright boards for animals alone? <b>Didn’t Rav Yitzḥak say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Upright <b>boards surrounding wells were permitted only</b> where the <b>wells</b> contain potable, running <b>spring water? If</b> the allowance is only <b>for animals, what is</b> the difference <b>to me</b> if it is <b>spring</b> water <b>and what is</b> the difference <b>to me</b> if it is <b>collected</b> water? Granted, collected water is inferior to spring water, but it is still suitable for animals to drink. The Gemara answers: <b>We require something that is fit for humans.</b><br>The Gemara examines the <i>baraita</i> cited in the course of the previous discussion. Returning to <b>the matter itself,</b> the statement quoted above: Upright <b>boards surrounding wells were permitted only for cattle, but a person must climb up</b> and <b>climb down</b> into the well and drink there. <b>But if</b> the wells <b>were</b> too <b>wide</b> for him to climb, <b>they are</b> permitted <b>for a person as well. A person may not fill</b> a bucket with <b>water and hold</b> it <b>before his animal on Shabbat, but he may fill</b> it <b>and pour</b> it <b>out</b> into a trough, <b>and</b> the animal <b>drinks of its own accord.</b><br><b>Rav Anan strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>If so, what purpose do the boards surrounding a well serve?</b> The Gemara immediately expresses its surprise: How can he ask <b>what purpose do they serve?</b> They allow people <b>to draw</b> water <b>from</b> the wells, which would otherwise be prohibited.<br><b>Rather,</b> Rav Anan’s question should be understood as follows: <b>What purpose is served</b> in requiring that the enclosed area be large enough for <b>the cow’s head and most of its</b> body, if in any case the cow may not be given to drink straight from the bucket?<br><b>Abaye said:</b> In fact, it is permitted to give the animal to drink in any manner in the area enclosed by the boards surrounding the well. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a special case, <b>with a manger</b> or trough <b>that stands in the public domain,</b> and is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <b>and</b> one <b>end of it interposes into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well. In such a case, the Sages prohibited one to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the upright boards and hold it before his animal; they were concerned that the manger might become damaged, and one might come to carry the bucket from the private domain into the public domain or vice versa while fixing the damaged manger.<br>It is prohibited to walk more than two thousand cubits from a city on Shabbat. However, if there are small watchmen’s huts [<i>burganin</i>] outside the city that are relatively close together, they are considered part of the city, and consequently the two thousand cubit limit is measured from the last such hut. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The law with regard to these <b>huts [<i>burganin</i>] does not apply in Babylonia, nor does</b> the allowance with regard to upright <b>boards surrounding a well apply outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.<br>The Gemara explains: The law with regard to <b>huts does not</b> apply <b>in Babylonia because floods are common</b> there; and since the huts are liable to be swept away by the floodwaters, they are not regarded as dwellings. The allowance with regard to upright <b>boards surrounding a well does not</b> apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>because <i>yeshivot</i> are not common</b> there, and the allowance was only granted to those traveling for the sake of a mitzva such as Torah study. <b>But we do</b> say <b>the opposite,</b> i.e., we apply the law of huts outside of Eretz Yisrael and we apply the allowance of upright boards surrounding a well in Babylonia.<br>The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The laws with regard to <b>huts and</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well</b> apply <b>neither in Babylonia</b> specifically, <b>nor outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael generally. The Gemara explains: The law with regard to <b>huts does not apply in Babylonia, because floods are common</b> there. It <b>also does not</b> apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>because thieves</b> who steal from such huts <b>are common</b> there; therefore, people do not regard the huts as dwellings.<br>The allowance with regard to upright <b>boards surrounding a well</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>in Babylonia, because water is common</b> there. Babylonia has many rivers and canals, and therefore wells are not essential there. <b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael in general it <b>also does not</b> apply, <b>because <i>yeshivot</i> are not common</b> there.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda said to Marei, son of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yirmeya bar Abba:</b> People <b>say</b> that <b>you walk from</b> the city of <b>Barnish to Daniel’s synagogue, which is</b> a distance of <b>three parasangs [<i>parsei</i>], on Shabbat. Upon what do you rely?</b> Do you rely <b>on the huts</b> located at the city’s outskirts that extend the Shabbat boundary toward the synagogue? <b>Didn’t your father’s father say in the name of Rav:</b> The law of <b>huts does not</b> apply <b>in Babylonia?</b><br>Marei then <b>went out and showed</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>certain</b> ruins of <b>towns that were subsumed within</b> a distance of <b>seventy cubits and a remainder,</b> two-thirds of a cubit, of each other. He relied upon the ruins, rather than upon the huts, to be permitted to walk the entire distance from Barnish to Daniel’s synagogue.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda said: Mari bar Mar interpreted homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I have seen a limit to every purpose; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad”</b> (Psalms 119:96)? <b>This</b> idea with regard to the breadth of the Torah <b>was stated by David, but he did not explain it;</b> it was <b>stated by Job, but he</b> too <b>did not explain it;</b> it was <b>stated by Ezekiel, but he</b> also <b>did not explain it, until Zechariah,</b> son of Berechiah, <b>son of Iddo, came and explained it.</b><br>Rav Ḥisda explains: This idea was <b>stated by David, but he did not explain it, as it is written: “I have seen a limit to every purpose; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad,”</b> i.e., he stated that the Torah is exceedingly broad, but he did not explain how broad. And likewise this idea was <b>stated by Job, but he</b> too <b>did not explain it, as it is written: “Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea”</b> (Job 11:9).<br>And similarly, it was <b>stated by Ezekiel, but he</b> also <b>did not explain it, as it is written: “And He spread it,”</b> the scroll, <b>“before me, and it was written inside and outside; and in it was written lamentations, and melody [<i>hegeh</i>], and woe [<i>vahi</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 2:10).<br>The Gemara explains: <b>“Lamentations,” this</b> refers to <b>the punishment of the righteous in this world, and so it is stated: “It is a lamentation and they shall make lament with it”</b> (Ezekiel 32:16). <b>“And melody [<i>hegeh</i>],” this</b> refers to <b>the reward of the righteous in the World-to-Come, and</b> the proof that this word is an expression of joy is the verse that <b>states:</b> “Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the harp, <b>to the melody [<i>higayon</i>] of a lyre”</b> (Psalms 92:4). <b>And “woe [<i>vahi</i>],” this is the punishment of the wicked in the World-to-Come, and so it states: “Calamity [<i>hova</i>] shall follow upon calamity”</b> (Ezekiel 7:26).<br>But nonetheless, Ezekiel did not explain the extent of the Torah, <b>until Zechariah,</b> son of Berechiah, <b>son of Iddo, came and explained it, as it is written: “And he said to me: What do you see? And I said: I see a flying [<i>afa</i>] scroll; the length of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it is ten cubits”</b> (Zechariah 5:2). Since the scroll was flying, the implication is that it had two equal sides, <b>so that when you open it, it is twenty by twenty</b> cubits. <b>And it is written: “And it was written inside and outside,”</b> i.e., on both sides. <b>And when you peel them apart</b> and separate the two sides, <b>how much is it?</b> Its entire area <b>amounts to forty by twenty</b> cubits, or eight hundred of God’s cubits.<br>In order to determine the measure of God’s cubit, the Gemara cites a verse that describes the size of the span between God’s thumb and little finger, in a manner of speaking. <b>And it is written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span,</b> and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12). If the entire world measures one square span, which is a quarter of one square cubit, <b>we find</b> according to this calculation that <b>the entire world is one</b> part <b>in three thousand and two hundred of the Torah.</b><br><b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> further <b>said: Mari bar Mar interpreted homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The Lord showed me, <b>and behold two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the Lord,</b> after Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen and the smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. <b>One basket [<i>dud</i>] had very good figs, like the figs</b><br><br>Daf 21b<br><br><b>that are first ripe, and the other basket [<i>dud</i>] had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten”</b> (Jeremiah 24:1–2).<br><b>Good figs, these are</b> the <b>full-fledged righteous</b> people; <b>bad figs, these are</b> the <b>full-fledged wicked</b> people. <b>And lest you say that the hope</b> of the wicked <b>is lost and their prospect is void, the verse states,</b> interpreting the word <i>duda’im</i> homiletically: <b>“The baskets [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance”</b> (Song of Songs 7:14), meaning that <b>both of them,</b> the righteous and the wicked, <b>will eventually yield a fragrance.</b><br><b>Rava interpreted</b> the verse cited above <b>homiletically</b> as follows: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The mandrakes [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of choice fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved” (Song of Songs 7:14)? <b>“The mandrakes [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance,” these are the young men of Israel who have never tasted the taste of sin.</b><br><b>“And at our doors [<i>petaḥeinu</i>] are all manner of choice fruits [<i>megadim</i>],” these are the daughters of Israel who inform [<i>maggidot</i>] their husbands about their passageway [<i>pit’ḥeihen</i>],</b> i.e., they tell them when they are menstruating. <b>Another version</b> of this interpretation is: <b>They bind [<i>ogedot</i>] their passageway</b> and save it <b>for their husbands,</b> and do not have relations with others.<br><b>“New and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved,” the Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> and continued: <b>Master of the Universe, I have decreed many decrees upon myself</b> through the enactments and ordinances of the Sages, <b>more than what You decreed upon me</b> in the Torah, <b>and I have fulfilled them.</b> These are the new laws which were added to the old ones stated in the Torah.<br>It was related that <b>Rav Ḥisda said to one of the Sages who would arrange the</b> traditions of the <b><i>aggada</i> before him: Did you hear what</b> the meaning of: <b>New and old</b> is? <b>He said to him: These,</b> the new, <b>are the</b> more <b>lenient mitzvot, and these,</b> the old, <b>are the</b> more <b>stringent mitzvot.</b><br>Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> This cannot be so, <b>for was the Torah given on two</b> separate <b>occasions,</b> i.e., were the more lenient and more stringent mitzvot given separately? <b>Rather, these,</b> the old, <b>are</b> mitzvot <b>from the Torah, and these,</b> the new, <b>are from the Sages.</b><br><b>Rava expounded</b> another verse in similar fashion: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And more than these, my son, be careful: of making many books [<i>sefarim</i>]</b> there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12)? <b>My son, be careful</b> to fulfill <b>the words of the Sages [<i>soferim</i>]</b> even <b>more than the words of the Torah. For the words of the Torah include positive and negative</b> commandments, and even with regard to the negative commandments, the violation of many of them is punishable only by lashes. <b>Whereas</b> with respect to <b>the words of the Sages, anyone who transgresses the words of the Sages is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, as it is stated: “And whoever breaches through a hedge, a snake shall bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8), taking hedges to refer metaphorically to decrees.<br><b>Lest you say: If</b> the words of the Sages <b>are of substance</b> and have such great importance, <b>why were they not written</b> in the Torah, therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of making many books there is no end,”</b> meaning that it is impossible to fully commit the Oral Torah to writing, as it is boundless.<br>What is the meaning of the words: <b>“And much study [<i>lahag</i>] is a weariness of the flesh”? Rav Pappa, son of Rav Aḥa bar Adda, said in the name of Rav Aḥa bar Ulla: This teaches that whoever mocks [<i>malig</i>] the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement,</b> which results from the weariness of the flesh of man.<br><b>Rava strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Is it written: Mock [<i>la’ag</i>]? “<i>Lahag</i>” is</b> the word that is <b>written. Rather,</b> the verse must be understood in the opposite manner: <b>Whoever meditates [<i>hogeh</i>] upon them,</b> the words of the Sages, <b>experiences</b> enjoyment as if it had <b>the taste of meat.</b><br>Concerning the significance of observing the words of the Sages, the Gemara relates: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It once happened that Rabbi Akiva was incarcerated in a prison, and Rabbi Yehoshua HaGarsi would</b> come to the prison to <b>attend to his</b> needs. <b>Every day</b> his disciples <b>would bring him water in a measured</b> quantity. <b>One day the prison guard met</b> Rabbi Yehoshua HaGarsi and <b>said to him:</b> The amount of <b>your water today is more</b> than usual; <b>perhaps you need</b> it <b>in order to</b> soften the walls and thus <b>undermine the prison. He</b> then <b>poured out half</b> the water, <b>and gave him</b> the other <b>half</b> to take in to Rabbi Akiva.<br><b>When</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>came to Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the latter saw the small amount of water he had brought, <b>he said to him: Yehoshua, do you not know that I am old, and my life depends on your life?</b> No one else brings me water, so if you bring me less than I need, my life is endangered.<br>After Rabbi Yehoshua <b>related to him the entire incident,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: Give me water so that I may wash my hands.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> The water that I brought <b>will not suffice for drinking;</b> how <b>will it suffice for washing your hands? He said to him: What can I do; for</b> transgressing the words of the Sages and eating without first washing hands <b>one is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty. And if so, it is <b>better that I should die my own death</b> by thirst, <b>rather than transgress the opinion of my colleagues</b> who enacted that one must wash hands before eating.<br><b>They said</b> that <b>he would not taste anything until</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>brought him water and he washed his hands. When the Sages heard about this, they said: If in his old age</b> and weakened state he is still <b>so</b> meticulous in his observance of the mitzvot, <b>how much more so</b> must he have been <b>in his youth.</b> And <b>if in prison</b> he is <b>so</b> scrupulous in his behavior, <b>how much more so</b> must he have been <b>when not in prison.</b><br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: At the time that</b> King <b>Solomon instituted</b> the ordinances of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> of courtyards <b>and</b> of <b>washing hands</b> to purify them from their impurity, which are added safeguards to the words of the Torah, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said</b> in his praise: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will be glad, even Mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15). <b>And it states</b> with regard to him: <b>“My son, be wise and make My heart glad, that I may respond to he who taunts Me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11).<br>The Gemara cites additional teachings that <b>Rava interpreted homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine has flowered, if the grape blossoms have opened, if the pomegranates are in flower; there will I give you my loves”</b> (Song of Songs 7:12–13)?<br>With regard to the words: <b>“Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field,” the Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, do not judge me like those who reside in large cities where there is robbery and licentiousness, and vain oaths and false oaths,</b> but rather: <b>“Let us go forth into the field,” come and I will show You Torah scholars who</b> work the land but nonetheless <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>in</b> poverty and in <b>distress.</b><br>With regard to the words, <b>“Let us lodge in the villages,” do not read</b> the phrase as: <b>In the villages [<i>bakefarim</i>], but rather</b> as: <b>By the deniers [<i>bakoferim</i>],</b> meaning, <b>come and I will show You</b> the nations of the world, <b>whom You showered with good, but</b> yet <b>they have denied You.</b><br><b>“Let us get up early to the vineyards,” these are the synagogues and houses of study. “Let us see if the vine has flowered,” these are the masters of Bible,</b> who are proficient in the first stage of Torah study. <b>“If the grape blossoms have opened,” these are the masters of Mishna. “If the pomegranates are in flower,” these are the masters of Gemara. “There will I give you my loves,”</b> means <b>I will show You my glory and my greatness, the praise of my sons and daughters,</b> how they adhere to sanctity.<br>The Gemara expounds further concerning King Solomon. <b>Rav Hamnuna said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his poems were a thousand and five”</b> (i Kings 5:12)? This <b>teaches that Solomon pronounced three thousand proverbs for each and every word of the Torah,</b> and <b>one thousand and five reasons for each and every word of the Scribes.</b><br><b>Rava</b> also <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And besides being wise, Koheleth also taught the people knowledge; and he weighed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:9). Rava interpreted homiletically: <b>He taught the people knowledge,</b> meaning <b>he taught it with the accentuation marks</b> in the Torah, <b>and</b> he <b>explained</b> each matter <b>by means of</b> something <b>similar to it.</b><br>With regard to: <b>“And he weighed [<i>izzen</i>], and sought out, and set in order many proverbs,” Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: At first the Torah was like a basket without handles [<i>oznayim</i>], until Solomon came and made handles for it.</b> By means of his explanations and proverbs he enabled each person to understand and take hold of the Torah, fulfill its mitzvot, and distance himself from transgressions.<br>With regard to the verse, “His head is as the most fine gold, <b>his locks [<i>kevutzotav</i>] are wavy [<i>taltalim</i>],</b> and black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said:</b> This <b>teaches that it is possible to expound from each and every stroke [<i>kotz</i>]</b> of the letters in the Torah <b>mounds upon mounds [<i>tilei tilim</i>] of laws.</b><br><b>Black [<i>sheḥorot</i>] as a raven [<i>orev</i>]</b> means: <b>In whom do you find</b> the words of Torah? <b>In him</b><br><br></body></html>
