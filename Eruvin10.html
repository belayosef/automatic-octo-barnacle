Daf 10a<br><br>The Gemara answers: This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that in order to permit carrying in a courtyard that was breached, <b>we require two</b> upright <b>boards,</b> one on either side of the breach. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a courtyard</b> was breached and opens into the public domain, and the width of the breach does not exceed ten cubits, it <b>becomes permitted</b> to carry there, even <b>with</b> only <b>one</b> upright <b>board</b> remaining on one side of the breach. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is permitted only <b>with two</b> upright <b>boards</b> remaining, one on each side of the breach.<br>The Gemara rejects this entire explanation: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the legal status of a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is not considered</b> like that of <b>a side post; and</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> that a side post or an upright board in a courtyard must be at least three handbreadths wide; <b>and that</b> the explanations of the mishna offered earlier by <b>Rabbi Zeira and Ravina are not</b> accepted; <b>that is why</b> there is significance to the fact that the <b>small</b> courtyard is <b>ten</b> cubits wide and the <b>large one is eleven</b> cubits wide. It is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Since Rabbi Yosei holds that a side post must be three handbreadths wide, we require that the two upright boards together measure six handbreadths, i.e., one cubit, which is the minimal difference in size between the two courtyards.<br><b>However, if you say</b> that the legal status of a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is considered</b> like that of <b>a side post; and</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira’s and Ravina’s</b> explanations <b>are</b> accepted as <i>halakha</i>; and that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>Rabbi Yosei, why do I</b> need to explain that the <b>large</b> courtyard measures <b>eleven</b> cubits?<br><b>Whichever way</b> you look at it, there is a difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is coming to permit</b> one to carry in <b>the large</b> courtyard, then a width <b>of ten</b> cubits <b>and two handbreadths suffices.</b> These two handbreadths can be considered the upright boards that render the courtyard fit for one to carry within it. <b>And if it is coming to</b> teach a novel <i>halakha</i> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and <b>prohibit</b> one to carry in <b>the small</b> courtyard, <b>it should teach us</b> a case where the walls of the two courtyards are much <b>farther removed</b> from each other, rather than a case where they are only one cubit apart. Therefore, the second explanation cannot be accepted.<br><b>Rather, can we not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is not considered</b> to have the legal status of <b>a side post?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b><br><b>Rav Yosef said: I did not hear this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rabba bar Rav Huna from my teachers. Rav Yosef had become ill and forgotten his learning, which is why he could not recall the <i>halakha</i> that a side post that is visible from the outside is considered to have the legal status of a side post.<br>His student <b>Abaye said to him: You</b> yourself <b>told us</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> it was <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>you told</b> it to <b>us. As Rami bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>a side post that extends along the wall of an alleyway</b> and beyond, in which case it appears from the inside to be a continuation of the wall but due to its narrow width it is clearly visible as a side post from the outside, if that side post is <b>less than four cubits</b> long <b>it is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post. And one may use</b> the alleyway <b>up to the inner edge</b> of the side post. However, if the side post itself extends <b>four cubits,</b> the alleyway has no side post and <b>it is considered to</b> have the legal status <b>of an alleyway, and it is prohibited to utilize the entire</b> alleyway.<br><b>And you said to us about this: Learn from this</b> statement <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <i>eiruvin</i>. <b>Learn from it</b> that in the area <b>between the side posts it is prohibited</b> to carry, as Rav Huna rules that one may use the alleyway only up to the inner edge of the side post. <b>And learn from it</b> that the minimal <b>length of an alleyway is four</b> cubits. <b>And learn from it</b> that a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall of the alleyway <b>from the inside is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post.</b><br>The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is that a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post.</b> The Gemara asks: It is possible that there is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of this opinion, <b>and</b> it is also <b>the <i>halakha</i>?</b> This opinion was refuted earlier. Can the <i>halakha</i> then be decided in accordance with it?<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it can <b>because Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with it.</b> Although the deductive analysis of the statements of other <i>tanna’im</i> led to different conclusions, the <i>halakha</i> relies on Rabbi Ḥiyya’s explicit statement.<br>The opening mishna states: If the entrance to an alleyway is <b>wider than ten</b> cubits, <b>one must diminish</b> its width. <b>Abaye said</b> that a Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: If the entrance to an alleyway <b>is wider than ten</b> cubits, <b>one must diminish</b> its width. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He need not diminish it.</b> The question arises: <b>Until what</b> width does Rabbi Yehuda still permit carrying in the alleyway?<br>Initially, <b>Rav Aḥai thought to say before Rav Yosef: Up to thirteen and a third cubits. And</b> he derived this figure through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> argument <b>from</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well.</b> Rabbi Yehuda maintains that if one placed upright boards up to thirteen and a third cubits apart from one another, he may consider the partitioned area around the well as a private domain and therefore carry within it.<br>Rav Aḥai explains: <b>Just as</b> in the case of upright <b>boards surrounding a well, where you permitted</b> carrying, even though the boards form a partition where the <b>breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>you did not permit</b> carrying <b>within them</b> if the gap between the boards is <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits</b> wide; in the case of <b>an alleyway, where you did not permit</b> carrying if the <b>breached</b> segment of its walls <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>is it not right that you will not permit</b> carrying <b>within it</b> if there is a gap <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits</b> wide?<br><b>But that</b> reasoning <b>provides</b> support for a contrary conclusion as well. Just as in the case of upright <b>boards surrounding a well, where you permitted</b> carrying <b>within them,</b> even though the boards form a partition where the <b>breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>you will not</b> extend the leniency and <b>permit</b> carrying <b>within them,</b> when the gap between the boards is <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits;</b> in <b>an alleyway, where you</b> were stringent and <b>did not permit</b> carrying when the <b>breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, in a case where most of the walls are standing, <b>you will</b> certainly <b>permit</b> carrying, even when the gap is <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits.</b><br><b>Alternatively,</b> one may argue <b>to the contrary.</b> One should be more stringent in the case of an alleyway. In the case of upright <b>boards surrounding a well, with regard to which you were lenient</b> and issued <b>one leniency, be lenient and</b> issue <b>another leniency</b> and maintain that a gap of up to thirteen and a third cubits still be considered an entrance. However, in the case of <b>an alleyway,</b> you should <b>not</b> be lenient <b>at all.</b> Therefore, there is no way to determine Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to the width of an alleyway entrance.<br><b>Levi taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to reducing the width of an alleyway in order to render it fit for one to carry within it. If <b>an alleyway is twenty cubits wide, one may stick a reed in</b> the <b>center</b> of its entrance <b>and</b> that is <b>sufficient</b> to create two separate alleyways, each ten cubits wide. <b>He taught</b> this <i>baraita</i>, <b>and he said</b> about <b>it that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with that teaching,</b> as the insertion of a reed is not effective in reducing the width. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Shmuel said in the name of Levi: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with that teaching.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, how should one act</b> in order to render an alleyway of that sort fit for one to carry within it? <b>Shmuel said in the name of Levi:</b><br><br>Daf 10b<br><br><b>One prepares a board ten</b> handbreadths <b>high with a length of four cubits and stands it lengthwise</b> down the middle <b>of the alleyway,</b> and thereby forms two small alleyways at the entrance to the alleyway, neither of which is more than ten cubits wide.<br><b>Alternatively,</b> one can act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>an alleyway is fifteen cubits wide,</b> how does one reduce its width? <b>He distances</b> himself <b>two cubits</b> from one of the walls of the alleyway <b>and prepares a board three cubits</b> wide, thereby leaving an opening of only ten cubits.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> must one reduce the width in this manner? <b>One</b> could also <b>prepare a board a cubit and a half</b> wide, <b>and distance</b> himself <b>two cubits, and</b> then <b>prepare</b> another board <b>a cubit and a half</b> wide, leaving the alleyway with an opening of only ten cubits. Apparently, one may <b>conclude from</b> the fact that Rav Yehuda did not suggest <b>this</b> possibility that if the <b>standing</b> segment of a wall is <b>greater than the breached</b> segment only when one combines the standing segments <b>from two directions,</b> i.e., both sides of the breach, it <b>is not considered</b> as though the <b>standing</b> segment were greater.<br>The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually, I would say to you</b> that ordinarily <b>it is considered</b> as <b>standing</b> even when one must combine the standing segments on the two sides of the breach. <b>However, it is different here, as the air,</b> i.e., the two cubit opening, <b>of this</b> one <b>side</b> of the far board <b>and the air,</b> i.e., the ten cubit opening, <b>of this</b> other <b>side</b> of the board <b>come</b> together <b>and negate it.</b> Therefore, in this case, the board that is farther from the wall cannot serve to close off the alleyway.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>And one</b> could instead <b>prepare a board</b> one <b>cubit</b> wide <b>and distance</b> himself one <b>cubit, and prepare</b> another <b>board</b> of <b>a cubit and distance</b> himself one <b>cubit, and prepare</b> a third <b>board</b> of one <b>cubit,</b> thus ensuring that the open space is not greater than the standing segment on both sides. Apparently, since Rav Yehuda did not suggest this possibility, one may <b>conclude from this</b> that if the <b>standing</b> segment of a wall <b>is equal to the breached</b> segment, carrying in the alleyway <b>is prohibited.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this assumption: <b>Actually, I would say to you</b> that ordinarily carrying <b>is permitted</b> in that case. <b>But here it is different, since the air,</b> the opening, <b>on this side</b> of the board <b>and the air,</b> the opening, <b>on that side</b> of the board <b>come</b> together <b>and negate</b> the effectiveness of the board.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> one could <b>distance</b> himself <b>one cubit</b> from the wall, <b>and prepare a board</b> of <b>a cubit and a half, and distance</b> himself another <b>cubit, and prepare</b> another <b>board</b> of <b>a cubit and a half.</b> In this manner, one could diminish the width of the entrance of the alleyway to ten cubits.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this would work equally as well. <b>But the Sages did not burden him this much,</b> requiring him to prepare two boards where one suffices.<br>The Gemara raises a new issue: <b>But let us be concerned lest one abandon</b> use of <b>the larger entrance,</b> which is ten cubits wide, <b>and</b> begin to <b>enter</b> the alleyway <b>through the smaller entrance,</b> which has a width of two cubits. This would negate the larger opening’s status as an entrance and render the alleyway unfit for one to carry within it, as it would no longer have an entrance with a side post. <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said:</b> The <b>presumption</b> is that <b>a person does not abandon a larger entrance and enter</b> instead <b>through a smaller entrance.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way is this <b>different</b> from the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi,</b> who maintain that in the case of an alleyway that is breached on its side wall close to its entrance, if the breach is large enough for one to enter through it, carrying in the alleyway is prohibited? There, too, such a breach should not be problematic, as a person does not abandon a larger entrance to enter through a smaller one.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the smaller entrance <b>reduces</b> his <b>walking</b> distance. If one approaches the alleyway from the side, the smaller entrance provides a shortcut, and therefore one might enter through it as well. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of the two entrances one two cubits and one ten cubits, <b>it does not reduce</b> his <b>walking</b> distance, as both openings are situated at the front of the alleyway.<br>The Gemara returns to the issue of the standing segment that is greater than the breached segment. <b>We learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Kelim</i>: <b>The leather</b> covering <b>of a stool</b> [<b><i>asla</i></b>] <b>and its hole join</b> together <b>to</b> complete <b>a handbreadth</b> with regard to ritual impurity imparted by a tent over a corpse. Any person, vessel, or food that is beneath a covering that is at least a handbreadth in size together with a portion of a corpse of at least an olive-bulk becomes ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the leather covering of a stool and its hole combine to complete the measure of a handbreadth.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is the leather</b> covering <b>of a stool</b> referred to in the <i>Tosefta</i>? <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rav Yoḥanan said: The leather covering of a bathroom.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>And how large</b> can the hole be and still combine with the leather covering to complete the handbreadth? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Two fingers</b> of leather <b>from here,</b> on one side, <b>and two fingers</b> of leather <b>from here,</b> on the other side, <b>and a space of two fingers</b> for the hole <b>in the middle.</b> However, <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: A finger and a half</b> of leather <b>from here, and a finger and a half</b> on the leather <b>from here, and a space of</b> a single <b>finger</b> for the hole <b>in the middle.</b><br><b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: Do</b> the two of <b>you,</b> yourself and Ravin, <b>disagree</b> in principle? Rav Dimi <b>said to him: No,</b> rather <b>this,</b> Ravin’s statement, <b>is referring to the large</b> finger, i.e., the thumb, and <b>this,</b> my own statement, <b>is referring to the small</b> finger, the pinkie, <b>and we do not disagree.</b> Both were describing one handbreadth, which equals the width of four thumbs or six pinkies.<br>Abaye <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not so</b> [<b><i>la’ei</i></b>]. <b>You disagree, and you disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the <b>standing</b> segment of a wall is <b>greater than the breached</b> segment only when one combines the standing segments <b>from two directions,</b> i.e., both sides of the breached segment. <b>According to you,</b> this wall <b>is considered as standing,</b> even when one must combine the standing segments <b>from two directions. According to Ravin,</b> if the standing segment <b>on one side</b> of the breach is greater, the wall <b>is considered as standing;</b> however, if the standing segment is greater only after combining the standing segments <b>from the two directions,</b> it <b>is not considered as standing.</b><br>Abaye continues: <b>For if it should enter your mind</b> to say that <b>you do not disagree,</b> but simply refer to the same measures by different names, <b>to</b> express his opinion, <b>Ravin should have said as follows: A finger and a third</b> of leather <b>from here, and a finger and a third</b> of leather <b>from here, and</b> a space of <b>a finger and a third</b> for the hole <b>in the middle.</b> In this case, there would still be a handbreadth in total, but each side of leather alone would not be larger than the space in the middle. The fact that Ravin presented a case where the hole in the middle is smaller than the width of the leather on either side indicates that his dispute with Rav Dimi is a fundamental one.<br>Rav Dimi responds: <b>Rather, what</b> do you wish to say, that <b>we disagree?</b> If so, <b>to</b> express the opinion attributed to <b>me, I should have said as follows: A finger and two thirds</b> of leather <b>from here, and a finger and two thirds</b> of leather <b>from here, and a space of two fingers and two thirds in the middle.</b> This would provide a more striking case where, despite the fact that the breach is much greater than the standing segments on either of its sides, the two standing segments combine together so that the standing segments are considered greater than the breached segment.<br><b>Rather, if there is</b> room <b>to say that we disagree,</b> our dispute relates to a different point, and <b>we argue</b> in the case where <b>the breached</b> segment <b>is</b> exactly <b>equal to the standing</b> segment on each side. According to Ravin, it is considered breached; while according to Rav Dimi, it is considered standing.<br>The Gemara returns to the mishna: <b>If</b> the entrance to the alleyway <b>has</b> an opening in the <b>form of a doorway,</b> then, <b>even if it is wider than ten</b> cubits, <b>one need not diminish</b> its width. The Gemara comments: <b>We find</b> that an opening in the <b>form of a doorway is effective</b> to permit carrying in an alleyway <b>with</b> regard to <b>its width,</b> i.e., when its entrance is more than ten cubits wide, <b>and</b> that <b>a cornice is effective with</b> regard to <b>its height,</b> i.e., when it is more than twenty cubits high.<br><br></body></html>
