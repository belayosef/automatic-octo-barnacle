Daf 63a<br><br><b>Rav Hamnuna issued</b> halakhic <b>rulings in</b> the town of <b>Ḥarta De’argez during the years of Rav Ḥisda’s</b> life, even though Rav Ḥisda was his teacher.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina</b> once <b>examined</b> a slaughterer’s <b>knife in Babylonia</b> to check if it was fit for slaughtering, during the lifetime of his teacher, Rav Ashi, who also lived in Babylonia. <b>Rav Ashi said to him: What is the reason</b> that the <b>Master acted in this manner?</b> Isn’t it prohibited for a disciple to issue rulings while his teacher is still alive?<br>Ravina <b>said to him: Didn’t Rav Hamnuna issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings in Ḥarta De’argez during the years of Rav Ḥisda’s</b> life, as they were not in the same town, even though they were both located in Babylonia? Since I do not live in the same town as you, it stands to reason that I would be permitted to issue rulings as well. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>It was</b> actually <b>stated</b> that Rav Hamnuna <b>did not issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings</b> during Rav Ḥisda’s lifetime, and that is the correct tradition.<br>Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: In fact, <b>it was stated</b> that Rav Hamnuna <b>issued rulings, and it was</b> also stated that he <b>did not issue rulings,</b> and both traditions are correct. <b>During the years of</b> the life of <b>Rav Huna,</b> Rav Hamnuna’s principal <b>teacher,</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>did not issue rulings</b> at all, <b>but he did issue rulings during the years of Rav Ḥisda’s</b> life, <b>for</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>was</b> Rav Ḥisda’s <b>disciple</b>-<b>colleague. And</b> since <b>I, too, am the Master’s disciple and colleague,</b> I should also be permitted to examine a slaughterer’s knife when I am not in the same town.<br><b>Rava said: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a knife <b>for himself</b> and use it for slaughtering, without having to show it to the local Sage. The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina happened</b> to come <b>to Meḥoza,</b> the home town of Rava. <b>His host brought</b> out <b>a knife</b> for slaughtering <b>and showed</b> it <b>to him. He said to him: Go, bring it to Rava,</b> the town Sage, for examination.<br>The host <b>said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> which <b>Rava said: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a slaughtering knife <b>for himself?</b> In this case I am using the knife to slaughter on your behalf. Ravina <b>said to him:</b> Since <b>I</b> am only <b>buying</b> the meat <b>from you,</b> it is not considered as though I am slaughtering for myself. Rava’s principle does not apply to such a case.<br>The Gemara cites a mnemonic for the names of the Sages mentioned in the following discussion: <b><i>Zila Lehanya</i>:</b> Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya; <b><i>Maḥlif</i>:</b> Rav Abba bar Taḥalifa; <b><i>Ika</i>:</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ika; <b>and <i>Ya’akov</i>:</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov.<br>The Gemara now relates that <b>Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya and Rav Abba bar Taḥalifa happened</b> to come <b>to the house</b> of <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, in the place</b> of jurisdiction <b>of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov. Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, wanted to prepare for them a third-born calf,</b> whose meat was considered a delicacy. <b>He brought</b> out a slaughtering <b>knife and showed</b> it <b>to them.</b><br><b>Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa said to them: Should we not be concerned with</b> the respect of <b>the Elder,</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, and present the knife to him for inspection, as this is his town? <b>Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya said to them:</b> That is unnecessary, since <b>Rava said as follows: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a knife <b>for himself. Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya</b> then <b>inspected</b> the knife, <b>but he was</b> later <b>punished</b> at the hand of Heaven for disregarding the honor of the senior rabbi.<br>The Gemara expresses surprise: What was Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya’s mistake? <b>Didn’t Rava say: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a slaughtering knife <b>for himself?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was different there, as they had</b> already <b>begun</b> to discuss the issue <b>of the honor</b> of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov. Had the name of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov never arisen, they would have been permitted to examine the knife themselves. Once his name had been mentioned, however, they should have approached him with the knife. Their failure to do so is considered a display of disrespect.<br><b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov is different, as he was illustrious</b> in age and wisdom, and thus deserved more honor than a regular Sage.<br><b>Rava said:</b> Even though it is ordinarily prohibited for a disciple to issue a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s place, if he does so <b>in order to separate</b> another person <b>from a prohibition</b> he is committing, <b>even in</b> his teacher’s <b>presence it seems well,</b> i.e., it is permitted. The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina was</b> once <b>sitting before Rav Ashi</b> when <b>he saw a certain man tying his donkey to a palm tree on Shabbat,</b> in violation of the decree of the Sages against utilizing trees on Shabbat. <b>He raised his voice to him</b> in protest, <b>but</b> the man <b>paid him no attention.</b> Ravina then <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>Let this man be in excommunication</b> for transgressing the words of the Sages and ignoring a scholar’s rebuke.<br>Afterward, Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: Behavior <b>such as this,</b> the way I acted in your presence just now, <b>does</b> it <b>appear like irreverent</b> behavior? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> With regard to this it is stated: <b>“There is no wisdom or understanding or council against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30). The Sages expounded this verse as follows: <b>Wherever a desecration of</b> God’s <b>name is involved, no respect is paid</b> even <b>to a teacher,</b> i.e., in such a situation one should disregard the respect due to his teacher’s wisdom and understanding and object to the inappropriate behavior.<br><b>Rava said:</b> With regard to one who issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s location without the intention of preventing someone from violating a prohibition, the following distinction applies: <b>In</b> the teacher’s actual <b>presence,</b> the disciple <b>is prohibited</b> to issue such a ruling, <b>and</b> if he does so, he <b>is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty at the hand of Heaven. However, when he is <b>not in his</b> actual <b>presence,</b> the disciple <b>is</b> still <b>prohibited</b> to issue the ruling, <b>but he is not liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty.<br>The Gemara asks: Is the disciple <b>not</b> liable to receive the death penalty if he issues his ruling <b>not in</b> the teacher’s <b>presence? But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The sons of Aaron died only because they issued a halakhic ruling before Moses, their teacher? What did they expound</b> in support of their conclusion that they must bring fire inside as opposed to waiting for fire to come down from the heavens? It is stated in the Torah: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar,</b> and lay the wood in order on the fire” (Leviticus 1:7), which led <b>them</b> to <b>say: Although fire descends from Heaven,</b> it is nonetheless <b>a mitzva to bring ordinary</b> fire. Although they derived this from the verses, they were punished for ruling in the presence of their teacher.<br>It was further related that <b>Rabbi Eliezer had a certain disciple who issued a</b> halakhic <b>ruling in his presence. Rabbi Eliezer said to his wife, Imma Shalom: I will be surprised if this one completes his year,</b> i.e., if he lives until the end of the year. <b>And</b> so it was, <b>he did not complete his year.</b><br>His wife <b>said to him: Are you a prophet?</b> He <b>said to her: I am not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, but I have received the following</b> tradition: <b>Anyone who issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty.<br><b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That disciple was named Yehuda ben Gurya, and he was three parasangs away from</b> Rabbi Eliezer. Apparently, one is liable for the death penalty even if he did not issue his ruling in his teacher’s presence.<br>The Gemara answers: In fact, the incident <b>took place in</b> the actual <b>presence</b> of the teacher, which is why the disciple was punished. The distance mentioned refers to the distance between the student’s usual place and the teacher. The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>But didn’t</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>say that he was three parasangs away from</b> his teacher? That implies that this was his distance from his teacher at the time of the ruling. The Gemara answers: <b>And, according to your reasoning,</b> that the details of the story must relate to the time of the ruling, <b>why</b> mention <b>his name and his father’s name? Rather,</b> the details were given so <b>that you should not say it was a parable.</b> That is also the reason why he provided the details concerning the student’s usual place. This does not contradict the fact that Yehuda ben Gurya issued his ruling in the actual presence of his teacher.<br>The Gemara continues to discuss the same topic. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whoever issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence is deserving of being bitten by a snake, as it is stated: “And Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young,</b> and you are very old; <b>therefore I held back</b> [<b><i>zaḥalti</i></b>] and I was afraid, and did not declare my opinion to you” (Job 32:6), <b>and it is written: “With the venom of the crawling things of</b> [<b><i>zoḥalei</i></b>] <b>the dust”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:24), which refers to snakes. Elihu’s statement is understood as follows: I must apologize for speaking in my teacher’s presence, for one who does so is liable to be punished with the bite of a snake.<br><b>Ze’eiri</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> Whoever issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence <b>is called a sinner, as it is stated: “Your word have I hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You”</b> (Psalms 119:11). In what case would speaking one’s word entail a sin? In a case where one rules on a matter of <i>halakha</i> in the presence of his teacher.<br><b>Rav Hamnuna raised a contradiction</b> between the verse previously mentioned and another verse: <b>It is written: “Your word have I hidden in my heart,”</b> implying that David did not want to reveal the words of Torah, whereas in a second verse <b>it is written: “I have preached righteousness in the great congregation”</b> (Psalms 40:10). He answered: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the verse in which David remained silent, it is referring <b>to the period when Ira HaYa’iri,</b> David’s teacher, <b>was alive; there,</b> in the verse where he publicized his words, it is referring <b>to the period when Ira HaYa’iri was no</b> longer <b>alive.</b><br>Having mentioned Ira HaYa’iri, the Gemara now cites a related teaching. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said: Whoever gives</b> all <b>his</b> priestly <b>gifts to one priest</b> has acted improperly and <b>brings famine into the world</b> as punishment. <b>As it is stated:</b> “And also <b>Ira HaYa’iri was a priest for David”</b> (II Samuel 20:26), which invites the question: <b>Was he a priest for David</b> alone, and <b>not for anyone else? Rather,</b> it means <b>that</b> David <b>would send</b> all <b>his</b> priestly <b>gifts to him</b> alone, i.e., he was the only priest to enjoy David’s gifts. <b>And it is written afterward: “And there was a famine in the days of David,</b> three years, year after year” (II Samuel 21:1).<br><b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Anyone who rules in his teacher’s presence <b>is lowered from his</b> position of <b>greatness, as it is stated: “And Elazar the priest said to the men of war</b> who went to battle: This is the statute of the Torah which the Lord commanded Moses” (Numbers 31:21). <b>Although</b> Elazar <b>said to</b> the soldiers: God commanded this statute <b>to</b> my <b>father’s brother, while to me He did not command</b> it, <b>even so he was punished</b> for speaking in this manner in the presence of his teacher, Moses.<br>What was his punishment? <b>As it is written</b> that God had told Moses with regard to Joshua: <b>“And he shall stand before Elazar the priest,</b> who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation” (Numbers 27:21). Elazar was originally awarded a place of great honor. <b>But we do not find</b> in the Bible <b>that Joshua</b> ever <b>had need of him.</b> It is never stated that Joshua made use of the Urim through Elazar, which shows that Elazar never achieved the greatness promised him.<br>With regard to this same issue, <b>Rabbi Levi said: Whoever answers a word in the presence of his teacher will go down to the netherworld childless, as it is stated: “And Joshua bin Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth, answered and said: My lord Moses, shut them in”</b> (Numbers 11:28). Since he spoke to his teacher out of turn, he was punished by remaining childless.<br><br>Daf 63b<br><br><b>And it is written</b> at the end of the list of the descendants of Ephraim: <b>“Non his son, Joshua his son”</b> (i Chronicles 7:27), which implies that Joshua himself had no children.<br><b>And this</b> tradition <b>differs from</b> the following statement of <b>Rabbi Abba bar Pappa, for Rabbi Abba bar Pappa said: Joshua was punished</b> to remain childless <b>only because he had prevented the Jewish people from</b> fulfilling the commandment of <b>being fruitful and multiplying for one night.</b> Therefore, he was punished measure-for-measure by not having children himself.<br><b>As it is stated: “And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked,</b> and, behold, a man stood over against him with his sword drawn in his hand” (Joshua 5:13), <b>and it is written</b> further: <b>“And he said: No, but I am captain of the host of the Lord, I am now come”</b> (Joshua 5:14). The man, an angel, came to demand something of Joshua and to rebuke him.<br>The angel <b>said to him: Last night,</b> due to your preparations for war, <b>you neglected the daily evening offering, and now,</b> tonight, <b>you are neglecting Torah study.</b> Joshua asked him: <b>For which of</b> these sins <b>have you come</b> specially to reprove me? He <b>said to him: “I am now come,”</b> i.e., the fact that I did not come last night, but waited until now, shows that the sin of neglecting Torah study is the more severe one.<br>Joshua <b>immediately</b> acted to rectify the matter by deciding that he must devote more time to learning Torah, as it is stated: <b>“And Joshua walked that night in the midst of the valley [<i>ha’emek</i>]”</b> (Joshua 8:13). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This <b>teaches that he walked</b> all night <b>in the depth [<i>be’omeka</i>] of <i>halakha</i>,</b> thereby atoning for his previous neglect of Torah study.<br><b>And they learned</b> as a tradition that <b>any time that the Ark and the Divine Presence are not resting in their</b> proper <b>places,</b> the entire Jewish people <b>are prohibited</b> from engaging <b>in marital relations.</b> Owing to the nation’s preoccupation with war, the Ark was not restored to its rightful place in the Tabernacle. Since Joshua did not attend to this state of affairs, he was responsible for the people’s neglect of the commandment to be fruitful and multiply, for which he was punished by remaining childless.<br>The Gemara now cites a further teaching in this regard: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: Torah study is greater than the offering of daily</b> sacrifices, as the angel <b>said to</b> Joshua: <b>“I am now come,”</b> i.e., on account of the second sin, demonstrating that neglect of Torah study is a more serious offense than neglect of the daily offerings.<br>With regard to the neglect of the commandment of procreation, <b>Rav Beruna said</b> that <b>Rav said: Whoever sleeps in a chamber in which a husband and wife are resting,</b> thus thwarting their intimacy, <b>the verse says about him: “The women of my people you cast out from their pleasant houses”</b> (Micah 2:9), and his punishment is detailed in that chapter.<br><b>And Rav Yosef said:</b> This applies not only to a woman who is ritually pure and permitted to her husband, but <b>even in</b> the case of a man <b>whose wife is menstruating,</b> for even then, although she is prohibited to him, they are more comfortable being alone together.<br><b>Rava said: If his wife is menstruating, may a blessing come upon</b> the person sleeping in the room, for he protects the couple from the possibility of sin. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But that is not so,</b> i.e., this argument is invalid, <b>for who protected</b> the husband <b>until now?</b> In other words, there is no need for concern in this case, and hence one must refrain from behavior that causes distress to the couple.<br>The Gemara returns to the issue of renting out domains for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara relates that <b>there was a certain alleyway in which</b> the gentile, <b>Laḥman bar Ristak, lived.</b> His Jewish neighbors <b>said to him: Rent us your domain,</b> i.e., your right to use the alleyway, so that it will not render it prohibited for us to carry. <b>He would not rent</b> it <b>to them,</b> and therefore they could not carry in the alleyway on Shabbat.<br>The Jewish neighbors <b>came</b> and <b>spoke to Abaye,</b> asking him how they might proceed. He <b>said to them: Go,</b> all of you, and <b>renounce your domains,</b> i.e., your rights to use the alleyway, <b>in favor of one</b> person, who will be permitted to carry in it. In this manner <b>it is</b> a case of <b>one individual</b> living <b>in the</b> same <b>place as a gentile. And</b> the <i>halakha</i> has already been established that in the case of <b>one individual</b> living <b>in the</b> same <b>place as a gentile,</b> the gentile <b>does not render it prohibited</b> for him to carry. Consequently, one person at least will be able to make use of the alleyway.<br><b>They said to him: But isn’t the reason</b> that no restrictions are imposed when one person lives together with a gentile in the same courtyard <b>only that it is not common for</b> people <b>to live</b> with a gentile in that fashion? <b>But here,</b> many people <b>are</b> in fact <b>living</b> in the same alleyway as the gentile. In this more common situation, the Sages did impose restrictions.<br>Abaye <b>said to them: Any renunciation of the domains</b> of many people <b>in favor of a</b> single <b>individual is an uncommon occurrence.</b> The principle is that in the case of <b>an uncommon occurrence, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> as a preventive measure. In pressing circumstances such as these, one may rely on this allowance.<br><b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, went</b> and <b>reported this <i>halakha</i> before Rava,</b> who <b>said to him:</b><br><br></body></html>
