Daf 33a<br><br><b>and he intended to establish his Shabbat residence at its base. And what</b> is the meaning of the terms <b>above and below,</b> as we said that this tree extends horizontally to the side, which indicates that it remains at a uniform height? After the tree leans horizontally beyond four cubits from the place of its roots, <b>it</b> rises once <b>again in an upright</b> position, and therefore the terms above and below are applicable.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it true that even if the <i>eiruv</i> is above ten handbreadths, <b>if one wants, he can</b> remove it from where it was deposited and <b>bring it by way of</b> the tree’s <b>leaves,</b> i.e., its branches that are above ten handbreadths, to within four cubits of the place where he intended to establish his Shabbat residence? Therefore, the <i>eiruv</i> should be valid even though it is above ten handbreadths.<br>The Gemara answers: We are dealing with a unique situation <b>where</b> the horizontal section of the tree is used by <b>the masses</b> to <b>shoulder</b> their burdens <b>on it,</b> i.e., to temporarily rest their loads on it, so that they can adjust them and easily lift them up again; <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that case <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla said:</b> With regard to <b>a pillar</b> that is <b>nine</b> handbreadths high and situated <b>in the public domain, and the masses</b> use it to <b>shoulder</b> their loads upon it, <b>and someone threw</b> an object from a private domain <b>and it came to rest upon it, he is liable,</b> as this pillar has the status of a public domain. Consequently, in the case of the tree, one may not bring the <i>eiruv</i> by way of the tree’s branches, as the horizontal section of the tree has the status of a public domain, and one may not carry from one private domain to another via a public domain.<br>The Gemara previously cited the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that anything that is prohibited on Shabbat due to rabbinic decree is not prohibited during the twilight period. The Gemara now attempts to clarify the matter: <b>What is</b> the source that originally cites <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, <b>and what is</b> the source which cites the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b><br>The Gemara cites the source of the disagreement: <b>As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>If one placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a tree above ten handbreadths</b> from the ground, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> If he placed it <b>below ten handbreadths, his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>, but he is prohibited to take it</b> on Shabbat in order to eat it because it is prohibited to use the tree on Shabbat. However, if the <i>eiruv</i> is <b>within three</b> handbreadths of the ground, <b>he is permitted to take it</b> because it is considered as though it were on the ground and not in a tree. If <b>one placed</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a basket and hung it on a tree, even above ten handbreadths, his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say:</b> In <b>any</b> situation in which the <i>eiruv</i> was placed in <b>a location where it is prohibited to take</b> it, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies: With regard <b>to which</b> statement did <b>the Rabbis state</b> their opinion? <b>If you say</b> they were referring <b>to the latter clause</b> with respect to the basket hanging from the tree, <b>let us say that the Rabbis hold</b> that using even <b>the sides</b> of a tree <b>is prohibited,</b> as making use of the basket is considered using the sides of a tree. <b>Rather,</b> the Rabbis’ statement must refer <b>to the first clause,</b> in which Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says that if one put the <i>eiruv</i> below ten handbreadths, his <i>eiruv</i> is valid, but he is prohibited to move it.<br>The Gemara clarifies further: <b>This tree, what are its circumstances? If it is not four</b> by four handbreadths wide, <b>it is an exempt domain,</b> i.e., a neutral place with respect to the laws of carrying on Shabbat, from which an object may be carried into any other Shabbat domain. In that case, the <i>eiruv</i> should be valid even if it was placed higher than ten handbreadths in the tree. <b>And if it is four</b> by four handbreadths wide, <b>when one places it in a basket, what of it?</b> What difference does it make? In any event it is in a private domain.<br><b>Ravina said: The first clause</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the tree <b>is four</b> by four handbreadths wide. The <i>eiruv</i> is not valid if it was placed above ten handbreadths because the tree at that height constitutes a private domain, and the <i>eiruv</i> cannot be brought to the public domain below, where one wishes to establish his Shabbat residence. <b>The latter clause,</b> however, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the tree <b>is not four</b> by four handbreadths wide, <b>and the basket completes</b> the width of the tree at that spot <b>to four.</b><br><br>Daf 33b<br><br><b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and he</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> the following in the case of an arched gateway in which the lower, straight-walled section is three handbreadths high, and the entire arch is ten handbreadths high: Even if, at the height of ten handbreadths, the arch is less than four handbreadths wide, one considers it as if he <b>carves out</b> the space <b>to complete</b> it, i.e., the arch has the legal status as though it were actually enlarged to a width of four handbreadths. Similarly, in our case the basket is taken into account and enlarges the tree to a width of four handbreadths.<br><b>And he</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: We require</b> that the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> rest <b>on a place</b> that is <b>four</b> by four handbreadths wide, <b>and</b> here <b>there is not</b> a width of four handbreadths without taking the basket into account.<br>The Gemara now asks: <b>What is</b> the source of the ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If one stuck a</b> cross <b>beam</b> into the ground <b>in the public domain and placed his <i>eiruv</i> upon it,</b> if the cross beam is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> so that it has the status of a private domain, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>; but if not, his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b><br>The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>On the contrary,</b> if the cross beam is not ten handbreadths high, why shouldn’t his <i>eiruv</i> be valid? <b>He and his <i>eiruv</i> are in the same place,</b> i.e., in the public domain. <b>Rather, this is what he said:</b> If the cross beam is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high, it is necessary that its top be four</b> handbreadths wide, so that it can be considered its own domain; but if it is <b>not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high, it is not necessary that its top be four</b> handbreadths wide because it is considered part of the public domain.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ravina offer his explanation, which maintains that we are dealing with a basket that completes the dimension of the tree to four handbreadths and yet it is not treated as a private domain? <b>It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> If <b>one stuck a reed</b> into the ground <b>in the public domain, and placed a basket [<i>teraskal</i>]</b> four by four handbreadths wide <b>on top of it, and threw</b> an object from the public domain, <b>and it landed upon it, he is liable</b> for carrying from a public domain to a private domain. According to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, if a surface of four by four handbreadths rests at a height of ten handbreadths from the ground, this is sufficient for it to be considered a private domain. Ravina’s explanation of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s position, however, does not appear to accept this assumption.<br>The Gemara refutes this and claims that this proof is not conclusive: <b>Even if you say</b> that Ravina’s explanation is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> a distinction can be made: <b>There,</b> in the case of the basket resting on a reed, the sides of the basket constitute <b>partitions</b> that <b>surround</b> the reed on all sides, and we can invoke the principle of: Lower the partition, according to which the partitions are viewed as extending down to the ground. Consequently, a kind of private domain is created within the public domain. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the basket hanging from the tree, the <b>partitions</b> of the basket <b>do not surround</b> the tree, and so they do not suffice to create a private domain.<br><b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi in the <i>Tosefta</i> can be explained in an entirely different manner: <b>A basket is different, since one can tilt it and</b> in that way <b>bring it to within ten</b> handbreadths of the ground. Without moving the entire basket, one can tilt it and thereby remove the <i>eiruv</i> in order to eat it, without carrying it from one domain to another.<br><b>Rav Pappa sat and recited this <i>halakha</i>. Rav bar Shabba raised an objection to Rav Pappa</b> from the following mishna: <b>What does one do</b> if a Festival occurs on Friday, and he wishes to establish an <i>eiruv</i> that will be valid for both the Festival and Shabbat? <b>He brings</b> the <i>eiruv</i> to the location that he wishes to establish as his residence <b>on</b> the eve of the <b>first</b> day, i.e., the eve of the Festival, <b>and stays</b> there <b>with it until nightfall,</b> the time when the <i>eiruv</i> establishes that location as his residence, <b>and</b> then <b>he takes it</b> with him <b>and goes away,</b> so that it does not become lost before Shabbat begins, in which case he would not have an <i>eiruv</i> for Shabbat. <b>On</b> the eve of the <b>second</b> day, i.e., on Friday afternoon, he takes it back to the same place as the day before, and <b>stays</b> there <b>with it until nightfall,</b> thereby establishing his Shabbat residence; and then he may then <b>eat</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>and go away,</b> if he so desires.<br><br></body></html>
