Daf 9a<br><br><b>drawn away</b> from the alleyway walls <b>or suspended</b> in the air, the following distinction applies: If the cross beam is <b>less than three</b> handbreadths from the walls, <b>one is not required to bring a different</b> cross <b>beam,</b> for it is considered attached to the walls based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, which views two solid surfaces as connected if the gap between them is less than three handbreadths wide. However, if the distance is <b>three</b> or more handbreadths from the walls, <b>he is required to bring a different</b> cross <b>beam</b> in order to permit carrying in the alleyway. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who holds that the principle of <i>lavud</i> applies to a gap of up to four handbreadths wide, <b>says:</b> If the cross beam is <b>less than four</b> handbreadths from the wall, <b>one is not required to bring a different</b> cross <b>beam;</b> but if the distance is <b>four</b> handbreadths from the wall, <b>he is required to bring a different</b> cross <b>beam.</b><br>The Gemara wishes to clarify the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What, is it not</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> speaks of a cross beam that is <b>drawn away</b> from the alleyway walls, it is referring to a cross beam that is distanced from the alleyway walls and situated <b>on the outside</b> in the public domain, similar to the case of the cross beam resting on pegs mentioned above? <b>And</b> when it speaks of a cross beam that is <b>suspended,</b> isn’t it referring to a cross beam that is distanced from the alleyway walls and placed <b>on the inside</b> in the alleyway? This interpretation contradicts Rava’s statement above that disqualifies such a cross beam.<br>The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> both <b>this,</b> the cross beam that is drawn away, <b>and that,</b> the crossbeam that is suspended, are located <b>on the inside</b> of the alleyway. The difference between them is that the cross beam that is <b>drawn away</b> is distanced from the wall <b>from one direction,</b> while a <b>suspended</b> cross beam does not lie on the alleyway walls at all, but is distanced from them <b>from both directions.</b><br><b>Lest you say</b> that if the cross beam is distanced from the wall <b>from one direction, we say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies, and it is as if the cross beam is joined to the wall; but if it is distanced from the wall <b>from two directions, we do not say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies. The <i>baraita</i>, therefore, comes and <b>teaches us</b> that there is no difference in this regard.<br><b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> refers to a cross beam that is <b>drawn away</b> from the walls <b>and</b> also <b>suspended</b> in the air. <b>And what are the circumstances</b> where this would be the case? <b>For example, where he inserted two bent pegs on</b> the tops of <b>the two alleyway walls,</b> and <b>the height</b> of the pegs from the top of the walls <b>is less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>and their bend</b> inward <b>is less than three handbreadths,</b> and a cross beam rests on top of them. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we either say <i>lavud</i>,</b> i.e., we consider the cross beam to be virtually extended and thus connected to the wall, <b>or we say <i>ḥavut</i>,</b> pressed down, that we consider the cross beam to be pressed down vertically; but <b>we do not say</b> both <b><i>lavud</i> and <i>ḥavut</i>.</b> The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that even in that case we say that any item adjacent to another with a gap of less than three handbreadths between them is considered connected to it, whether to the side or below, and even in both directions at once.<br><b>Rabbi Zakkai taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The area <b>between the side posts and beneath the</b> cross <b>beam</b> has the <b>legal status</b> of a <b><i>karmelit</i>,</b> and it is forbidden to carry in it. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Exit</b> and <b>teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>outside,</b> i.e., this <i>baraita</i> is not in accordance with the accepted <i>halakha</i>, and therefore it should not be made part of the regular learning in the study hall.<br>The Gemara records a dispute with regard to the scope of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>Abaye said: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is reasonable</b> with regard to the area <b>beneath the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> as only the area beneath the cross beam should be considered a private domain, <b>but between the side posts,</b> carrying <b>is</b> indeed <b>prohibited,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Zakkai. <b>And Rava said:</b> The entire statement of Rabbi Zakkai is to be rejected, as Rabbi Yoḥanan asserted, and <b>even</b> in the area <b>between the side posts</b> carrying <b>is permitted.</b><br><b>Rava said: From where do I</b> know to <b>say this,</b> that carrying is permitted even between the side posts? <b>For when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A place that has</b> an area of <b>less than four by four</b> handbreadths and is located between a public and private domain but belongs to neither has the status of an exempt domain with regard to carrying on Shabbat. Therefore, <b>it is permitted for</b> both <b>the people in the public domain</b> as well as <b>the people in the private domain to</b> use it for <b>loading</b> their burdens <b>onto their shoulders, so long as they do not exchange</b> objects with one another. Therefore, a place having an area of less than four handbreadths is not considered a <i>karmelit</i>, but rather an exempt domain, where carrying is permitted. Consequently, the area between the side posts should likewise be considered an exempt domain, and carrying should be permitted within it.<br><b>And Abaye</b> said that this offers no proof, as <b>there,</b> with regard to Rav Dimi’s statement, the area being discussed <b>is</b> at least <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> setting it apart from the other domains. It is therefore considered a domain in its own right, and has the <i>halakha</i> of an exempt domain.<br>The Gemara considers the position of Abaye: <b>Abaye said: From where do I</b> know to <b>say this,</b> that the area between the side posts has the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>karmelit</i>? <b>For Rav Ḥama bar Guria said that Rav said:</b> The area <b>within the opening,</b> i.e., the doorway between two entrance posts that serve as side posts to permit carrying in the alleyway, <b>requires another side post</b> in order <b>to permit</b> carrying there, for the entrance posts alone do not suffice. This demonstrates that it is forbidden to carry in the space between the side posts without another side post.<br><b>And if you say that</b> this is a case where the doorway <b>has</b> an area <b>four by four</b> handbreadths, and therefore an additional side post is required to permit carrying there, this is not a valid argument. <b>For didn’t Rav Ḥanin bar Rava say that Rav said:</b> The area <b>within the opening</b> itself, <b>even if it does not have</b> an area of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths, <b>requires an additional side post</b> in order <b>to permit</b> carrying within it. This indicates that the area between the side posts is not to be used.<br><b>And Rava</b> replies that a distinction must be made between the cases: <b>There,</b> the case of Rav’s ruling refers to a scenario where the alleyway’s entrance <b>opens to a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> and thus the space between the entrance posts is also viewed as a <i>karmelit</i>, and an additional side post is required.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>But</b> if the entrance opens <b>to a public domain, what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would it be <b>permitted</b> to carry there even without an additional side post? If so, it follows that the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>karmelit</i> is more stringent than that of a public domain. However, this seems untenable, for carrying in a <i>karmelit</i> is prohibited only by rabbinic decree, owing to the similarity between a <i>karmelit</i> and the public domain. This is similar to a situation where <b>a permanent resident is</b> down <b>on the ground, while a stranger is</b> raised up <b>to the highest heaven,</b> the very opposite of the appropriate state of affairs.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>Yes,</b> it is possible that this is the ruling, for we can say that <b>it has found its own type and been awakened.</b> In other words, as the area within the entranceway is not a defined domain, it doesn’t have the status of an independent domain. Therefore, when it opens into a <i>karmelit</i>, to which it is similar, its status is negated, and it joins with the <i>karmelit</i> to form a single unit. However, when it opens into a public domain, it cannot join with it because it is not similar to a public domain, which has a totally different set of laws; and therefore it is considered part of the alleyway, and it is permitted to carry within it.<br><b>Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: And you do not hold</b> that in the area <b>between the side posts</b> carrying <b>is prohibited? But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say that Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>an alleyway was lined with side posts, each</b> one set more than three but <b>less than four</b> handbreadths apart from its neighbor, <b>we have arrived</b> in this matter <b>at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis</b> with regard to the measure of <i>lavud</i>.<br>How so? According <b>to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who <b>said</b> that if the gap between two items is less than four handbreadths, <b>we say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies; all the side posts are considered a single side post. <b>He may</b> therefore only <b>utilize</b> the alleyway <b>up to the inner edge of the innermost side post,</b> but no more. However, according to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who <b>say</b> that <b>we do not say</b> the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies unless the gap is less than three handbreadths, he <b>may utilize</b> the alleyway <b>up to the inner edge of the outermost</b> side post. This discussion demonstrates that the argument revolves around the question as to which side post establishes the permitted area. <b>But</b> with regard to the area <b>between the side posts, all agree</b> that carrying <b>is prohibited.</b><br><b>And Rava</b> answers that <b>there too,</b> it refers to a case where the alleyway’s entrance <b>opens to a <i>karmelit</i>.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if the entrance opens <b>to a public domain, what</b> is its legal status – would carrying be <b>permitted?</b> If so, the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>karmelit</i> is more severe than that of a public domain. Once again, this can be likened to a situation where <b>a permanent resident is</b> down <b>on the ground, while a stranger</b> is raised up <b>to the highest heaven.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> indeed, this is the ruling, but one should not be perplexed, as we have explained: <b>it has found its own type and been awakened.</b><br><br>Daf 9b<br><br>The Gemara provides an alternative explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, carrying in the area between the side posts is actually permitted. The dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis concerning the principle of <i>lavud</i> is in a case <b>where</b> there was an alleyway <b>that one lined with side posts, each</b> positioned <b>less than four</b> handbreadths from the next, and the side posts extend <b>for a length of four cubits.</b><br><b>According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said</b> that for a gap of up to four handbreadths <b>we say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies, all the side posts are considered a single side post, and since the side post in that case is four cubits long, <b>it is</b> considered a separate <b>alleyway;</b> therefore, it <b>requires an additional side post to permit</b> carrying in <b>it. And according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies unless the gap is less than three handbreadths, this area <b>does not require an additional side post to permit</b> carrying within it.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> why is another side post required? <b>Let it</b> have the same legal status <b>as</b> a side post that is <b>visible from the outside,</b> protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <b>but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside.</b> Since it is evident from the outside that it is a side post and not part of the building, carrying is permitted there.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>As</b> Rav Ashi’s <b>reason is only according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>didn’t</b> he say that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If a side post is <b>visible from the outside,</b> protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <b>but</b> it appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside,</b> it <b>is not considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post?</b><br>An amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> If a side post is <b>visible from the inside,</b> protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <b>but</b> it appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the outside,</b> it <b>is considered a side post.</b> However, if a side post is <b>visible from the outside</b> protruding from the wall, <b>but</b> it appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside,</b> there is a disagreement between <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, with regard to its status. <b>One said: It is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post. And</b> the other <b>one said: It is not considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies: <b>Conclude that Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> is the one <b>who said</b> that <b>it is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post, as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught:</b> In the case of <b>a wall</b> at the entrance to an alleyway <b>whose one side is more recessed than the other, whether</b> the recess <b>is visible from outside</b> the alleyway <b>but</b> appears to be <b>even from the inside, or</b> the recess <b>is visible from the inside but</b> appears to be <b>even from the outside,</b> it <b>is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post.</b> The Gemara states: Indeed, <b>conclude</b> that Rabbi Ḥiyya is the one who said it has the legal status of a side post.<br>The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who explicitly said that a side post of that kind is not considered a side post, <b>did he not hear this</b> <i>halakha</i>? The <i>Tosefta</i> was widely known. <b>Rather, he heard it, but he does not hold</b> in accordance with <b>it.</b> Perhaps, then, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya also does not hold</b> in accordance with <b>it.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>. <b>That is why he did not teach it. But Rabbi Ḥiyya, if it is</b> true <b>that he does not hold</b> in accordance with <b>it, why would he teach it?</b><br><b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> If a side post is <b>visible from the outside,</b> protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <b>but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside, it is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post. Rabba said: And we raise an objection to our</b> own <b><i>halakha</i></b> from a mishna: With regard to <b>a small courtyard that was breached</b> along the entire length of one of its walls so that it opens <b>into a large</b> courtyard, in <b>the large one</b> it <b>is permitted</b> to carry <b>and</b> in <b>the small one</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry. This is <b>because</b> the breach <b>is considered an entrance of the large</b> courtyard. The wall of the smaller courtyard was breached along its entire length, therefore there is no visible partition from inside the smaller courtyard. However, the partition is noticeable from the outside, i.e., in the large courtyard, since the breach is flanked on both sides by the remaining segments of the wall of the large courtyard. <b>And if it is so,</b> that a partition that is visible from the outside is considered a partition, carrying in <b>the small</b> courtyard <b>should also be permitted</b> in this case, <b>as</b> the wall <b>is visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even from the inside.</b><br><b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This mishna is referring to a case <b>where the walls of the small</b> courtyard <b>protrude into the large one,</b> i.e., the breached wall of the small courtyard is not in line with the wall of the large one. Therefore, even when viewed from the outside there are no walls visible, and that is why carrying is prohibited there.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And let us say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies, <b>and</b> then carrying <b>will be permitted</b> even in the small courtyard. The ends of the breached wall should be considered attached to the side walls of the large courtyard, rendering the wall of the large courtyard visible. Then it will be permitted to carry in the small courtyard based on the principle governing side posts visible from the outside.<br><b>And if you say that</b> the walls of the smaller courtyard <b>are too separate</b> from the walls of the larger courtyard, such that the distance between the walls is too great for the principle of <i>lavud</i> to apply, <b>didn’t Rav Adda bar Avimi teach before Rabbi Ḥanina:</b> The <b>small</b> courtyard of which they speak is referring even <b>to</b> one <b>ten cubits</b> wide; the <b>large</b> one is referring even <b>to</b> one <b>eleven</b> cubits wide? Apparently, this <i>halakha</i> applies even when the difference in width between the courtyards is a single cubit, which is six handbreadths. Assuming the small courtyard is located equidistant from the ends of the large courtyard, only three handbreadths separate it on each side from the wall of the large one. Therefore, the principle of <i>lavud</i> applies.<br><b>Ravina said:</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the walls of the smaller courtyard <b>are separated from this wall</b> of the larger courtyard <b>by two</b> handbreadths <b>and from this wall</b> of the larger courtyard on the other side <b>by four</b> handbreadths. Since there is a distance of more than three handbreadths, the principle of <i>lavud</i> does not apply.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And let us say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies <b>from one direction,</b> then carrying <b>will be permitted</b> even in the small courtyard.<br><br></body></html>
