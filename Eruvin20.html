Daf 20a<br><br>that the <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>two types of tree; here too,</b> then, you can say that it teaches <b>two types of fence,</b> and therefore no proof can be brought from this <i>baraita</i>.<br><b>And Abaye</b> further <b>inquired of Rabba:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard, the</b> open <b>end of which interposed between the boards</b> surrounding a well, <b>what is</b> the law <b>with regard to carrying from inside</b> the courtyard <b>to</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards, and from</b> the area <b>between the boards into</b> the courtyard? Rabba <b>said to him: It is permitted.</b><br>Abaye then asked him: And if <b>two</b> adjacent courtyards interposed between the boards surrounding a well, <b>what</b> is the law? Is it permitted to carry from inside them to the area between the boards, and vice versa? Rabba <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>It is prohibited.</b><br><b>Rav Huna said:</b> In the case of <b>two</b> courtyards, it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry, <b>even if</b> the residents of the two courtyards <b>made an <i>eiruv</i></b> together. This is because of <b>a decree lest they</b> come to <b>say</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> is effective for</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards. Rava,</b> however, disagreed and <b>said:</b> If <b>they made an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, it <b>is permitted</b> to carry between the courtyards and the area between the boards, and vice versa; with the preparation of the <i>eiruv</i>, the two courtyards are regarded as one.<br><b>Abaye said to Rava:</b> What <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports your</b> opinion, for the <i>baraita</i> states: In the case of <b>a courtyard, one end of which interposes between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well, <b>it is permitted to carry from inside</b> the courtyard <b>to</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards, and from</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards into</b> the courtyard, <b>but</b> if there were <b>two</b> adjacent courtyards, <b>this is prohibited. With regard to which case was this statement made?</b> The statement applies <b>where</b> the residents of the two courtyards <b>did not make an <i>eiruv</i></b> together; <b>but if they made an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, it <b>is permitted</b> to carry between the courtyards and the area between the boards, and vice versa.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this is a refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Huna,</b> for the <i>baraita</i> explicitly contradicts his opinion? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you: There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case where the two courtyards <b>later became joined</b> by means of the wall that separated them being breached, and it is clear to all that it is a single courtyard, so that there is no concern that people will say that an <i>eiruv</i> is effective for the area between the boards.<br><b>Abaye asked Rabba</b> yet another question: If <b>the water</b> in the cistern <b>dried up on Shabbat, what is</b> the law? Is it still permitted to carry between the boards? Rabba <b>said to him:</b> The boards <b>are considered</b> a valid <b>partition only on account of the water;</b> since <b>there is no</b> longer any <b>water here, there is</b> also <b>no</b> longer a valid <b>partition here.</b><br><b>Ravin raised a dilemma: If the water</b> in the well <b>dried up on Shabbat, and</b> then <b>on</b> the same <b>Shabbat</b> it rained and other water <b>came</b> in its place, <b>what is</b> the law? Is the original allowance to carry restored? <b>Abaye said to him:</b> The case where the water <b>dried up on Shabbat should not be a dilemma for you, for I</b> already <b>raised this dilemma before my Master,</b> Rabba, <b>and he resolved for me that it is prohibited to</b> carry in the enclosed area.<br>The case where other water <b>came</b> on Shabbat <b>should also not be a dilemma for you, for</b> this <b>is</b> a case of <b>a partition erected on Shabbat, and it was</b> already <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any partition erected on Shabbat, whether</b> it was erected <b>unwittingly, or whether intentionally, whether by unavoidable accident, or whether willingly, it is called</b> a valid <b>partition.</b> The fact that it was erected in a prohibited manner, in violation of prohibitions related to building, does not negate its effectiveness.<br>Ravin raised a difficulty: <b>Was it not stated with regard</b> to this <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: They only taught</b> that such a partition is called a partition as a stringency; it is prohibited by Torah law <b>to throw</b> objects from an area enclosed by such a partition into the public domain and vice versa, <b>but to carry in it</b> as a full-fledged private domain is <b>not</b> permitted by the Sages?<br>The Gemara refutes this objection: <b>Rav Naḥman’s statement applies</b> only in a case where the partition was erected <b>intentionally.</b> Since the partition was erected intentionally on Shabbat, the Sages imposed a penalty that it is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area. However, in the case of a partition that was erected unwittingly or that arose by itself, no such penalty was imposed, and it is permitted to carry there.<br><b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who throws</b> an object from the public domain <b>into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well is liable.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> for <b>were it not</b> a valid <b>partition, how could he be permitted to draw</b> water from the well? This shows that it is a full-fledged private domain.<br>The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar’s ruling <b>is only necessary</b> to teach that in the case <b>where one arrange</b> an enclosure <b>similar to the</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well in the public domain,</b> in a place where there was no well, <b>and threw</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain, <b>he is liable.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t this obvious as well?</b> As, <b>were it not</b> regarded as <b>a partition in general, how could he be permitted to carry in</b> the case of <b>a cistern?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It is only necessary</b> to teach you that <b>even though</b> such a partition does not bar entry and <b>many</b> people <b>pass through it,</b> it is nonetheless considered a partition in regard to Shabbat.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And what is he teaching us</b> by this statement, <b>that the</b> passage of <b>many</b> people <b>does not come and negate</b> the effectiveness of <b>a partition? But Rabbi Elazar stated</b> this idea <b>once</b> before.<br><b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the following with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well: <b>If the path of the public domain</b> passes through the area of the wells and the posts and <b>obstructs them, he</b> must <b>divert it to the sides,</b> or else the partition is invalid. <b>And the Rabbis say: He need not</b> divert the path of the public domain, for even if many people pass through there, the partition is valid. With regard to this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both said: Here,</b> the Rabbis <b>informed you of the strength of partitions.</b> Therefore, we see that Rabbi Elazar already expressed his opinion that the validity of a partition is not canceled by the passage of many people through it.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it was derived <b>from there</b> alone, <b>I would have said</b> that what Rabbi Elazar meant is that <b>here</b> the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions, <b>but he,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>does not agree</b> with them. <b>He</b> therefore <b>teaches us</b> in his present ruling that what he meant is that <b>here</b> they informed you of this law <b>and he agrees</b> with them.<br>The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>say this</b> ruling that one who throws an object into the area enclosed by upright boards is liable, <b>and he would not have need to</b> make his <b>other</b> comment that here the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar did not in fact make two statements, but rather <b>one was stated by inference from the other.</b> He only made one of these statements explicitly; the other was reported by his students in his name based on an inference from what he had said.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>It is permitted to bring</b> the upright boards <b>closer to the well,</b> provided that the enclosed area is large enough for a cow to stand in and drink, with its head and most of its body inside the partitioned space. Similarly, <b>we learned there</b> in a mishna: <b>A person may not stand in a public domain and drink in the private domain,</b> and likewise he may not stand <b>in the private domain and drink in a public domain, unless he brings his head and most of his</b> body <b>into the place where he is drinking.</b><br><br>Daf 20b<br><br><b>And</b> the law is <b>likewise in a winepress</b> with respect to tithes. As long as one’s head and most of his body is in the winepress, he may drink from the wine without first separating tithes because drinking wine in a winepress is considered incidental drinking, which does not require tithing. The activity of harvesting and ingathering grapes is not considered completed as long as the grapes are in the winepress, since the grapes are still intended for making wine. Consequently, at this stage one may consume the produce in a casual, incidental manner. Once the work has been completed, however, one must tithe the produce before consuming any of it.<br>The Gemara clarifies several laws related to this issue: <b>With regard to a person, it was said</b> in connection to these laws <b>that it is necessary</b> that <b>his head and most of his</b> body be inside the domain from which he is drinking. However, a question may be raised <b>with regard to a cow</b> standing in a public domain and drinking from a private domain, or vice versa: <b>Is it necessary</b> that <b>its head and most of its</b> body be inside the domain from which it is drinking, <b>or not?</b><br>The Gemara clarifies: <b>Wherever</b> one <b>holds the bucket</b> from which the cow is drinking <b>but does not hold</b> the animal, there <b>should not be a dilemma for you,</b> for <b>it is</b> certainly <b>necessary</b> for <b>its head and most of its</b> body to be <b>inside,</b> as the cow might move backward and pull the bucket with it, causing him to carry it from one domain to the other. <b>Where there should be a dilemma for you</b> is <b>where he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal. <b>What</b> is the law in such a case?<br><b>He said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> a resolution to this dilemma, for we have learned in the mishna: It is permitted to bring the upright boards closer to the well, <b>provided that</b> the enclosed area is large enough for <b>a cow</b> to stand in, with <b>its head and most of its</b> body <b>inside</b> the partitioned space <b>and drink. Does this not</b> refer even to a case <b>where</b> one <b>holds</b> the cow <b>and</b> also <b>holds the bucket?</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this may refer exclusively to the case <b>where he holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And where he holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal, <b>is it permitted</b> to give his animal to drink in such a fashion? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not fill</b> a bucket with <b>water and hold</b> it <b>before his animal on Shabbat; but he may fill</b> it <b>and pour</b> it <b>out</b> into a trough, <b>and it,</b> i.e., the animal, <b>drinks of its own accord?</b> Consequently, we see that it is prohibited to give an animal to drink from a bucket if he does not hold the animal.<br>The Gemara refutes this: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abaye said: Here</b> we are dealing with a cow standing inside a house with windows open to the public domain, eating from <b>a manger</b> or trough <b>that stands in the public domain</b> that is <b>ten handbreadths high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <b>and one end</b> of this manger <b>interposes into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well?<br>In such a case, it is prohibited to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the upright boards and hold it before his animal, unless the animal is within the enclosed area. This is a rabbinical <b>decree, lest one see that the manger was damaged</b> on the side in the public domain <b>and go to fix it, and he might take the bucket with him,</b> thereby <b>carrying</b> it <b>from the private domain to the public domain.</b> Rather, he must pour out the water into the manger, so that it reaches the animal on its own.<br>The Gemara asks: Even if he carried the bucket into the public domain, <b>would he be liable in such a case? Didn’t Rav Safra say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>one who transfers objects from corner to corner</b> in a house, <b>and changed his mind about them</b> while carrying them <b>and carried them out</b> to the public domain, <b>he is exempt because the lifting at the first moment was not for that</b> purpose of carrying out to a different domain; when he picked them up, he intended merely to move them around his house. Here too, then, one should not be liable, since when he picked up the bucket he did not intend from the outset to carry it into the public domain; accordingly, there is no room for such a decree.<br><b>Rather,</b> say that the decree is due to a different concern, that <b>at times one would fix</b> the manger <b>and</b> then <b>bring</b> the bucket <b>back in again,</b> thereby <b>carrying from the public domain into the private domain.</b> In this case one picks up the bucket from the outset with the intention of carrying it from a public domain into a private domain.<br><b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion. <b>With regard to a person, we said that it is sufficient</b> if <b>his head and most of his</b> body are inside the domain from which he is drinking. But a question may be raised <b>with regard to a cow</b> standing in a public domain and drinking from a private domain, or vice versa: <b>Is it sufficient</b> if <b>its head and most of its</b> body are inside the domain from which it is drinking, <b>or not?</b> Perhaps all of the cow must be in that domain.<br>The Gemara clarifies the question. The case <b>where</b> one <b>holds the bucket</b> from which the cow is drinking <b>and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal <b>should not be a dilemma for you,</b> as <b>it is</b> certainly <b>enough</b> if <b>its head and most of its</b> body are in the domain. <b>Rather,</b> the case <b>where there should be a dilemma for you</b> is <b>where he holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case?<br><b>He said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> a resolution to this dilemma in the mishna: It is permitted to bring the upright boards closer to the well, <b>provided that</b> the enclosed area is large enough for <b>a cow</b> to stand in, with <b>its head and most of its</b> body <b>inside</b> the partitioned space, <b>and drink. Doesn’t this</b> refer even to a case <b>where</b> one <b>holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this may refer only to the case <b>where he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say this, <b>for if one holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal, <b>is it</b> in fact <b>permitted</b> to give his animal to drink in such a fashion? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not fill</b> a bucket with <b>water and hold</b> it <b>before his animal</b> on Shabbat. <b>But he may fill</b> it <b>and pour</b> it <b>out</b> into a trough, <b>and</b> the animal <b>drinks of its own accord.</b><br>The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abaye said: Here,</b> we are dealing with <b>a manger that stands in the public domain,</b> and it is <b>ten handbreadths high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <b>and one end</b> of the manger <b>interposes into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well, and the animal is standing at the other end in the public domain. In such a case, it is prohibited to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the boards and hold it before his animal, unless the animal is within the enclosed area. This is a rabbinical decree, lest <b>at times one see that the manger was damaged</b> on the side in the public domain <b>and go to fix it and take the bucket with him,</b> thereby <b>carrying</b> it <b>from the private domain into the public domain.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>But would he be liable in such a case? Didn’t Rav Safra say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>one who transfers objects from corner to corner</b> in a house, <b>and changed his mind about them</b> while carrying them <b>and took them out</b> to the public domain, <b>he is exempt because the lifting at the first moment was not for that</b> purpose of carrying out to a different domain; when he picked them up, he intended merely to move them around his house. Here too, then, he should not be liable, since when he picked up the bucket he did not intend from the outset to carry it into the public domain; accordingly, there is no room for such a decree.<br><b>Rather,</b> we must say that the decree is due to a different concern, that <b>at times one would fix</b> the manger <b>and</b> then <b>bring</b> the bucket <b>back in again, carrying from the public domain into the private domain.</b> In this case, he picks up the bucket with the intention of carrying it from a public domain into a private domain. In any case, no proof can be brought from this source.<br>The Gemara cites a different proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>A camel whose head and most of its</b> body <b>are inside</b> a private domain <b>may be force-fed from inside</b> the private domain. <b>Now, force-feeding is like</b> the case where <b>he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal, as one cannot force-feed an animal without holding it by its neck, <b>and</b> nonetheless <b>we require</b> that <b>its head and most of its</b> body be inside the domain where it is eating.<br><b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: A camel is different, as since its neck is long,</b> its head and most of its body must be inside; otherwise it could stretch its neck into the public domain, and the one feeding it might come to carry the bucket from the private domain into the public domain. In the case of other animals, however, there is no reason for such stringency.<br>The Gemara attempts to cite yet another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>An animal whose head and most of its</b> body <b>were inside</b> a private domain <b>may be force-fed from inside</b> the private domain. <b>Now,</b> as stated above, <b>force-feeding is like</b> the case where <b>he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal, <b>and</b> nonetheless <b>we require</b> that <b>its head and most of its</b> body be inside the domain where it is eating. The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>What is</b> this <b>animal that is taught</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>also a camel.</b><br>The Gemara objects: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> as <b>animal</b> in one <i>baraita</i>, <b>and wasn’t it taught</b> as <b>camel</b> in the other <i>baraita</i>? The implication is that this law applies not only to camels, but to other animals as well.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Were</b> these two <i>baraitot</i> <b>taught next to each other?</b> Had both of these <i>baraitot</i> been taught together, we would indeed expect the <i>tanna</i> not to teach the same law using different formulations. However, since these two <i>baraitot</i> come from different sources, it is possible that one of the <i>tanna’im</i> referred to a camel with the generic term animal, and hence no proof can be brought from here. <b>This</b> same idea that a camel is different <b>was also taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer prohibits</b> this <b>in the case of a camel, since its neck is long.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Adda said:</b> Upright <b>boards surrounding wells were only permitted to Festival pilgrims.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>boards surrounding wells were permitted only for cattle?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>What is</b> the <b>cattle</b> mentioned here? It means <b>the cattle of festival pilgrims. However, a person</b><br><br></body></html>
