Daf 28a<br><br>If <b>one ate a <i>putita</i>,</b> a certain water insect, <b>he is given four</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> as he has transgressed four separate negative Torah commandments, two that relate to creeping animals in general and two that relate to water insects in particular. If he ate <b>an ant, he is given five</b> sets of <b>lashes</b> for violating the two general prohibitions and another three negative commandments stated with regard to insects that creep upon the earth. If he ate <b>a hornet, he is given six</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for in addition to the prohibitions applying to an ant, he has transgressed a prohibition stated with regard to flying insects. <b>And if it is</b> correct that something that lives in water is considered as growing from the ground, one who eats <b>a <i>putita</i> should also be given lashes for</b> violating the following prohibition: “And <b>every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). Rather, fish must certainly not be considered as growing from the ground, and therefore this explanation is to be rejected.<br><b>Rather, Ravina said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between</b> the two <i>baraitot</i> with regard to <b>fowl. According to the one who said</b> that one may use second-tithe money only to purchase food which is <b>the produce of produce and grown from the ground, these</b> fowl <b>are also</b> regarded as having <b>grown from the ground.</b> However, <b>according to the one who said</b> that we apply it to that which is <b>the offspring of the offspring of the earth, these fowl were created from mud</b> and not from the ground, and consequently they are not included among the items that may be bought with second-tithe money.<br>These two distinct opinions are both based upon the exegetical principle of a generalization and a detail. The Gemara now asks: <b>What is the reason of the one who includes fowl, and what is the reason of the one who excludes fowl?</b><br>The Gemara explains: <b>The one who includes fowl holds</b> that when there is a generalization, a detail, and another generalization, <b>the latter generalization is primary.</b> Therefore, the rule is similar to that governing <b>a detail</b> followed by <b>a generalization,</b> which maintains that <b>the generalization is considered an addition to the detail, and all</b> other <b>items are included.</b> However, <b>the first generalization is effective in excluding anything that is not similar to</b> it <b>in two respects,</b> as it is nonetheless a case of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization. Therefore, he excludes anything that does not grow from the ground and is not the produce of produce.<br><b>And the one who excludes fowl holds</b> that <b>the first generalization is primary.</b> Therefore, a generalization, detail, and generalization is similar to a single <b>generalization</b> that is followed by <b>a detail,</b> with regard to which we maintain that <b>the generalization only includes that which is</b> spelled out <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, with regard to <b>these</b> items mentioned in the verse, <b>yes,</b> one may purchase them with second-tithe money. With regard to <b>something else, no,</b> one may not. However, <b>the latter generalization is effective to include anything that is similar to it in three respects,</b> namely, it is the produce of produce, grows from the ground, and is offspring of the offspring of the earth, to the exclusion of fowl.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat,</b> who said <b>in the name</b> of <b>Rav: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with cheap and unimportant produce such as <b>cress, purslane, and sweet clover, but</b> one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with green grain or with unripe dates.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>But may one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with sweet clover? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>sweet clover</b> that <b>those who have many children may eat</b> it, but <b>those without children may not eat</b> it, as it is harmful to one’s reproductive capacity; <b>and if it was hardened into seed,</b> i.e., if it became very hard and already fit to be planted, <b>even those who have many children may not eat</b> it? Therefore, we see that it is prohibited to eat sweet clover. How can it possibly be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>?<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Interpret</b> Rav’s statement as referring to sweet clover <b>that was not</b> yet <b>hardened into seed, and</b> its use for establishing an <i>eiruv</i> is limited to <b>those who have many children</b> and are therefore permitted to eat it.<br><b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say</b> instead that <b>actually,</b> sweet clover is fit for an <i>eiruv</i> even <b>for those without children because it is fit</b> to be eaten by <b>those who have many children.</b> The food used for an <i>eiruv</i> must be edible, but it does not need to be edible for the particular person using it as his <i>eiruv</i>. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a nazirite with wine, and for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>? Apparently,</b> these items may be used as an <i>eiruv</i> <b>even though</b> they <b>are not fit for this</b> person, because they are <b>fit for that</b> other person. <b>Here too, even though</b> the sweet clover <b>is not fit for this</b> person, it may be used because <b>it is fit for that</b> other person.<br><b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say</b> instead: <b>When Rav said</b> that sweet clover may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, he was referring to <b>Median clover,</b> which is of superior quality and is not harmful.<br>The Gemara considers the continuation of Rav’s statement: <b>And</b> may one <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with green grain? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say that Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>dodder and green grain, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with them; and</b> when eating <b>them one recites the blessing: Who creates the fruit of the ground?</b><br>The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first statement, according to which green grain may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, was made <b>before Rav came to Babylonia. That</b> second statement was made <b>after Rav came to Babylonia</b> and saw that people there ate green grain, at which point he ruled that it is fit to be used for an <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Is Babylonia the majority of the world?</b> Laws are established according to the custom prevalent in most of the world. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>beans, barley, and fenugreek that</b> one <b>planted</b> in order to use <b>as an herb,</b> e.g., as animal fodder, <b>his opinion is rendered irrelevant by the opinions of all other people?</b> Since most people do not act this way, we do not consider this particular person’s intention to be significant. <b>Therefore, one is obligated</b> to tithe <b>their seeds, and their herbs are exempt.</b> When one harvests these plants in their green state, before their seeds have matured, they are regarded as not having fully ripened. However, in the case of <b>cress and arugula,</b> which are commonly eaten both in their green state and as seeds, if <b>one planted them</b> in order to use them <b>as herbs, they are tithed</b> both <b>as herbs and as seeds;</b> if <b>one planted them for</b> their <b>seeds, they are tithed as seeds and as herbs,</b> no matter how they are eaten. In any case, the first part of the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the law is determined in accordance with the common custom of most of the world and not with the practice in one particular place.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>When Rav said</b> that green grain may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>,<br><br>Daf 28b<br><br>he was referring <b>to the garden variety,</b> which is commonly eaten.<br>Having mentioned <b>arugula seeds,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>For what are they suitable?</b> Generally, only the plant’s leaves are eaten. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The earlier</b> generations, <b>who had no pepper, would crush</b> these seeds <b>and dip</b> their <b>roasted meat in them.</b> Therefore, arugula seeds are also eaten, even though this is not their typical use.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>when Rabbi Zeira was exhausted from his studies, he would go and sit at the entrance</b> to the academy <b>of Rav Yehuda bar Ami,</b> and <b>say: When the Sages go in and out, I shall stand up before them and receive reward for</b> honoring <b>them,</b> as it is a mitzva to honor Torah scholars. Too tired to engage in actual Torah study, he sought a way to rest while fulfilling a different mitzva at the same time.<br>Once, a young <b>school child was leaving</b> the study hall. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: What did your teacher teach you</b> today? <b>He said to him:</b> The proper blessing for <b>dodder</b> is: <b>Who creates the fruit of the ground;</b> the proper blessing for <b>green grain</b> is: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: On the contrary, the opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable,</b> as <b>this,</b> the green grain, <b>derives nourishment from the ground, whereas that,</b> the dodder, <b>derives nourishment from the air,</b> and it is fitting to recite a blessing over each item in accordance with its source of nourishment.<br>The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the</b> young <b>school child. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>This,</b> the dodder, is <b>fully ripened produce, and that,</b> green grain, is <b>not fully ripened produce.</b> If produce is not fully ripened one can only recite the blessing: By Whose word all things came to be. <b>And that which you said: This,</b> the green grain, <b>derives nourishment from the ground, whereas that,</b> the dodder, <b>derives nourishment from the air, this is not so. Dodder also derives nourishment from the ground, for we see that when the</b> prickly <b>shrub is cut off, the dodder</b> attached to it <b>dies.</b> This shows that dodder also derives its nourishment from the ground, albeit indirectly.<br>The Gemara now considers the next part of Rav’s statement: <b>And</b> is it correct that <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with unripe dates? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Heart of palm,</b> the soft, edible inner core of a palm tree, <b>may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money; but it does not contract the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods,</b> as it is not actually a food, but rather a part of the tree itself. <b>And unripe dates may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money, and</b> they even <b>contract the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> this somewhat differently: <b>Heart of palm is like a tree in all its</b> legal <b>aspects, except that it may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> as it is edible. <b>And unripe dates are like fruit in all regards,</b> as they are actual fruit, <b>except</b> with respect to one characteristic, which is <b>that they are exempt from tithes</b> because they are not yet fully ripened.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the <b>fruit</b> of palms that <b>never</b> fully <b>ripen</b>. They are therefore regarded as full-fledged fruit even in their unripe state. Rav, however, was referring to the fruit of palms, which eventually ripen. Their unripe state is merely a transitional stage in their development.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If so, would Rabbi Yehuda say with regard to this</b> that <b>they are exempt from tithes? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: The unripe figs of</b> the place called <b>Beityoni were only mentioned with regard to tithes,</b> as it was stated: In the case of <b>the unripe figs of Beityoni, and the unripe dates of</b> the place called <b>Tuvina, one is obligated to tithe them</b> even though they never ripen, since they are considered full-fledged fruit in all respects?<br><b>Rather,</b> say as follows: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is not referring to</b> the <b>fruit</b> of palms that <b>never</b> fully <b>ripen,</b> but rather to the fruit of palms that eventually ripen. However, the <i>halakha</i> <b>pertaining to the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods is different,</b> and an item’s status as a food with regard to the impurity of foods cannot be brought as proof of its status as a food with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> elsewhere: <b>Since they are fit to be sweetened through</b> cooking with <b>fire,</b> they are regarded as food for the purpose of tithes; <b>here too,</b> we can say: <b>Since they are fit to be sweetened through</b> cooking with <b>fire,</b> unripe dates are fit to contract the impurity of foods. However, with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, we require food that is ready for consumption, and something that can be prepared to become food is not sufficient.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Where was</b> this comment of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> originally <b>stated?</b> The Gemara answers: It was stated <b>on this</b> ruling, <b>which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One is <b>obligated</b> to tithe <b>bitter almonds</b> while they are still <b>small</b> and green, as they are fit to be eaten while still undeveloped. When they are <b>large,</b> however, one is <b>exempt</b> from tithing them, as they are no longer edible. One is <b>obligated to</b> tithe <b>sweet, large</b> almonds, whereas one is <b>exempt from</b> tithing <b>small ones,</b> as they have not yet fully ripened. <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yosei, said in the name of his father:</b> One is <b>exempt from</b> tithing <b>both this and that,</b> large and small bitter almonds. <b>And some say</b> that he said in the name of his father: One is <b>obligated to</b> tithe <b>both this and that. Rabbi Ila said: Rabbi Ḥanina ruled in Tzippori in accordance with the one who said:</b> One is <b>exempt from</b> tithing <b>both this and that.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the view of <b>the one who said</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> tithe <b>both this and that, for what are</b> large, bitter almonds <b>suitable? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Since</b> these almonds <b>are fit to be sweetened</b> and made edible <b>through</b> cooking with <b>fire,</b> they are regarded as food for the purpose of tithes.<br>The Gemara further examines the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>The Master said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Heart of palm is like a tree in all its</b> legal <b>aspects, except that it may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money.</b> The Gemara asks: Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion <b>is</b> identical to that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b><br><b>Abaye said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where <b>one boiled or fried</b> the heart of palm. According to Rabbi Yehuda, it does not contract the ritual impurity of foods even if it was boiled or fried, whereas the first <i>tanna</i> holds that in that case it does contract impurity.<br><b>Rava strongly objects to this: Is there</b> really <b>anyone who said</b> that even if <b>one boiled or fried it,</b> it does <b>not</b> contract the ritual impurity of foods? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The hide and the placenta</b> of an animal, which people do not typically eat, <b>do not contract the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods;</b> however, <b>a hide that one boiled</b> until it became edible <b>and a placenta that one intended</b> to eat <b>do contract the impurity of foods?</b> This indicates that even something not originally fit to be eaten contracts the impurity of foods once it has been boiled or fried, and the same should apply to heart of palm according to all opinions.<br><b>Rather, Rava said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>the blessing</b> that must be recited prior to eating, <b>for it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the blessing recited over heart of palm: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> the appropriate blessing is: <b>Who creates the fruit of the ground. And Shmuel said</b> the appropriate blessing is: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.</b><br>The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> the appropriate blessing is: <b>Who creates the fruit of the ground, as it is food.</b> Since heart of palm is edible it is called a fruit, and we recite a blessing over it in the manner of all fruits. <b>And Shmuel said</b> the appropriate blessing is: <b>By Whose word all things came to be. Since it will eventually harden</b> and become like an inedible tree, <b>we do not recite over it the blessing: Who creates the fruit of the ground,</b> as it will eventually lose the status of a fruit.<br><b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, your opinion is reasonable, as a radish will eventually harden, and</b> yet <b>we recite over it the blessing: Who creates the fruit of the ground.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>But it is not so,</b> because <b>people plant radish with the intention</b> of eating it while it is <b>soft; but people do not plant palm trees with the intention</b> of eating <b>heart of palm.</b> Therefore, heart of palm is not considered the fruit of the palm, but rather food extracted from it, over which only the following blessing should be recited: By Whose word all things came to be. <b>And</b> the Gemara concludes: <b>Even though Shmuel praised Rav Yehuda, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b><br>The Gemara now examines <b>the matter itself</b> cited in the previous discussion in the name of Rav. <b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said</b> with regard to <b>dodder and green grain: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with them, and</b> when eating <b>them one recites the blessing: Who creates the fruit of the ground.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How much dodder</b> must be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Yeḥiel said</b> with regard to a similar issue: <b>A handful. Here, too,</b> the measure is <b>a handful.</b><br>Similarly, <b>how much green grain</b> is needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rabba bar Toviya bar Yitzḥak said that Rav said: A full farmers’ bundle.</b><br><b>Rav Ḥilkiya bar Toviya said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with glasswort.</b> The Gemara expresses astonishment: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with glasswort?</b> People do not eat glasswort. <b>Rather,</b> one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with the herb from</b> whose ashes <b>glasswort</b> is prepared, as it is fit for human consumption before it is burnt. <b>And how much</b> of it is needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rav Yeḥiel said: A handful.</b><br>The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> once <b>went out to</b> visit certain <b>villages,</b> and the villagers <b>asked him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to establishing an <i>eiruv</i> with moist beans? He did not have</b> an answer for them. <b>When he came to the study hall, they said to him: This is what Rabbi Yannai said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with moist beans. And how much</b> is needed for that purpose? <b>Rav Yeḥiel said: A handful.</b><br><b>Rav Hamnuna said: One may</b> also <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with raw beets.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Ḥisda say: Raw beet kills a healthy person,</b> which indicates that beets are unhealthy and should therefore be unfit for establishing an <i>eiruv</i>?<br><br></body></html>
