Daf 99a<br><br>The Gemara explains: Rav Ḥinnana <b>maintains that from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> was <b>likewise</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. But</b> in fact <b>that is not so: The latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, while the first clause</b> is in accordance with that of <b>the Rabbis.</b><br>We learned in the mishna: One may move objects in a public domain when he is standing in a private domain, <b>provided that he does not carry</b> them <b>beyond</b> four cubits in the public domain. The Gemara infers: This teaching indicates that if <b>he carried</b> them beyond four cubits, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>this</b> ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, as Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who carries an object</b> in a public domain <b>from the beginning of four</b> cubits <b>to the end of</b> those <b>four</b> cubits, even if he <b>carried it above his head,</b> i.e., he lifted the object above his head so that it passed through an exempt place, <b>he is</b> nonetheless <b>liable</b> for carrying four cubits in a public domain. Here, too, although he is standing in an elevated private domain and carries the object at that elevated height, he is still liable.<br>The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Is</b> the mishna <b>teaching</b> that <b>if he carried</b> the object beyond four cubits <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering? Perhaps</b> the mishna means: <b>If he carried</b> the object beyond four cubits, he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering, <b>but it is</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> by rabbinic decree to do so.<br><b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion: The Gemara’s initial inference was actually that if <b>he carried</b> the object beyond four cubits he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering, <b>but it is prohibited</b> by rabbinic decree to do so. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us say</b> that this <b>is a conclusive refutation of Rava’s</b> opinion, <b>as Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who carries</b> an object in a public domain <b>from the beginning of four</b> cubits <b>to the end of</b> those <b>four</b> cubits, even if he <b>carried it above his head, he is liable.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Is</b> the mishna <b>teaching</b> that <b>if he took</b> it beyond four cubits he is <b>exempt, but it is prohibited</b> to do so? <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>tanna</i> means that <b>if he carried</b> it beyond four cubits, he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b><br>The mishna states: <b>A person</b> may <b>not stand in a private domain</b> and urinate or spit into the public domain. <b>Rav Yosef said: One who urinated or spat</b> in this manner is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> for an act of carrying to be considered a prohibited Shabbat labor that entails liability, <b>we require</b> that the <b>lifting and placing</b> of the object be performed <b>from atop an area four</b> by four handbreadths, the minimal size of significance with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of carrying on Shabbat. <b>And</b> that is <b>not</b> the case here, as one’s mouth, which produces the spittle, is not four by four handbreadths in size.<br>The Gemara answers: One’s <b>intent renders it an area</b> of significance, i.e., as one certainly considers his mouth a significant area, it is regarded as four by four handbreadths in size. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that the size of an area is not the sole criterion, but that a person’s thoughts can also establish a place as significant, there is a difficulty with <b>that</b> which <b>Rava said:</b> If <b>a person threw</b> an object <b>and it landed in the mouth of a dog or in the mouth of a furnace,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering. But don’t we require</b> that the object be <b>placed on an area of four</b> by four handbreadths? <b>And</b> that is <b>not</b> the case here.<br><b>Rather,</b> the person’s <b>intent</b> to throw the object into the dog’s mouth <b>renders it an area</b> of significance. <b>Here too, his intent renders</b> his own mouth <b>a</b> significant <b>area.</b><br><b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b> If <b>one</b> is standing <b>in a private domain, and the opening of his</b> male <b>member is in the public domain,</b> and he urinates, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? How should this case be regarded? Do <b>we follow</b> the domain where the urine is <b>uprooted</b> from the body, i.e., the bladder, which is in the private domain? <b>Or</b> do <b>we follow the</b> point of the urine’s actual <b>emission</b> from the body, and since the urine leaves his body through the opening of his member in the public domain, no prohibition has been violated? Since this dilemma was not resolved, the Gemara concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved.<br>The mishna states: <b>And likewise, one</b> may <b>not spit</b> from one domain to another. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Once a person’s spittle is gathered in his mouth, he may not walk four cubits in the public domain until he removes it. The Gemara asks: Does this teaching mean that it is prohibited to do so <b>even if he has not turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, i.e., after he has dredged up the saliva but before he has rolled it around in his mouth in preparation to spit it out?<br><b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna the <i>halakha</i> of one who <b>was eating a dried fig</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>with unwashed hands?</b> By Torah law, only food that has come into contact with a liquid is susceptible to ritual impurity, and no liquid had ever fallen on this fig. The significance of the fact that his hands are unwashed is that by rabbinic law, unwashed hands have second degree ritual impurity status and therefore invalidate <i>teruma</i>. If this person <b>inserted his hand into his mouth to remove a pebble, Rabbi Meir deems</b> the dried fig <b>impure,</b> as it had been rendered liable to contract impurity by the spittle in the person’s mouth, and it subsequently became impure when it was touched by his unwashed hand. <b>And Rabbi Yosei deems</b> the fig <b>ritually pure,</b> as he maintains that spittle which is still in one’s mouth is not considered liquid that renders food liable to contract impurity; the spittle does so only after it has left the mouth.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that there is a distinction between the cases: If <b>he turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, it is like spittle that has been detached from its place, and therefore its legal status is that of a liquid, which means the fig is <b>impure.</b> However, if <b>he</b> had <b>not</b> yet <b>turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, the fig is <b>pure.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, spittle that has not yet been turned over in one’s mouth is not considered detached.<br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions is reversed,</b> as the opinion attributed to Rabbi Yehuda is actually that of a different <i>tanna</i>, while Rabbi Yehuda himself maintains that the fig is ritually impure in either case.<br><b>Reish Lakish said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions, <b>and</b> the apparent contradiction can be reconciled in accordance with the original version of the text: <b>With what we are dealing here</b> in the mishna? We are dealing <b>with his phlegm</b> that is expelled through coughing.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty against this resolution. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>one’s phlegm was detached,</b> he may not walk four cubits in the public domain with it in his mouth? <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> refers to <b>spittle that was detached?</b> The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No,</b> this ruling applies only to <b>one’s phlegm that was detached.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>one’s phlegm was detached, and likewise,</b> if <b>his spittle was detached, he</b> may <b>not walk four cubits</b> in the public domain <b>before he spits</b> it out, even if he has not yet turned it over. <b>Rather, it is clear as we originally answered,</b> that the opinions in the mishna with regard to spittle and ritual impurity must be reversed.<br>Having mentioned phlegm, the Gemara cites a related teaching: <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One who expelled <b>phlegm in front of his master</b> has acted in a disrespectful manner and is <b>liable for</b> the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated: “All they who hate Me love death”</b> (Proverbs 8:36). <b>Do not read it</b> as: <b>“They who hate [<i>mesanai</i>] Me”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>“Those who make themselves hateful [<i>masniai</i>] to Me,”</b> i.e., those who make themselves hateful by such a discharge.<br>The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: <b>But doesn’t he</b> do so <b>involuntarily,</b> as no one coughs and emits phlegm by choice; why should this be considered a transgression? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking</b> here of someone who had <b>phlegm</b> in his mouth <b>and spat</b> it out, i.e., one who had the opportunity to leave his master’s presence and spit outside.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>stand in a private domain</b> and extend his head <b>and drink in a public domain,</b> and he may stand <b>in a public domain and drink in a private domain, only if he brings his head and most of his</b> body <b>into the domain</b> in <b>which he drinks. And the same</b> applies <b>in a winepress,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara registers surprise at the mishna: It would seem that <b>the first clause,</b> i.e., the previous mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that a person located in one domain is permitted to move objects in another domain, <b>whereas the latter clause,</b> i.e., this mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that it is prohibited for a person in one domain to move objects in a different domain.<br><b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This mishna is referring <b>to objects that one needs, and</b> the ruling is accepted by <b>all.</b> In this case, even the Rabbis concede that it is prohibited to move objects in another domain, lest one absent-mindedly draw the objects to him and thereby violate a Torah prohibition.<br><b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one of the domains is a <b><i>karmelit</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Abaye said: This</b> case <b>is</b> equal <b>to that</b> case, i.e., in this situation a <i>karmelit</i> is governed by the same <i>halakha</i> that applies to a domain defined by Torah law. Just as the Sages prohibited one in the private domain from drinking from the public domain and vice versa, so too, they prohibited one in a <i>karmelit</i> from drinking in the same manner. <b>Rava said:</b> How can you say so? The prohibition against carrying to or from a <i>karmelit</i> is <b>itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree. And will we</b> then <b>proceed to issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b><br><b>Abaye said</b> in explanation of his opinion: <b>From where do I say that</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in the mishna:<br><br>Daf 99b<br><br><b>And the same</b> applies <b>in a winepress.</b> This winepress cannot be a private domain, as the first clause of the mishna already dealt with a private domain. The winepress must therefore be a <i>karmelit</i>, which proves that it is prohibited to drink from a <i>karmelit</i> while standing in a public domain.<br><b>And Rava said:</b> This proof is not conclusive, as the words: The same applies in a winepress, do not refer to Shabbat but <b>to the matter of</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>tithes,</b> as explained below. <b>And similarly, Rav Sheshet said</b> that the statement that <b>the same</b> applies <b>in a winepress</b> refers <b>to the matter of tithes.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies this statement. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>drink</b> grape juice directly <b>on the winepress</b> <i>ab initio</i> without tithing, <b>whether</b> the juice was diluted <b>with hot</b> water, even though he will then be unable to return the leftover wine to the press, as it would ruin all the wine in the press, <b>or whether</b> the juice was diluted <b>with cold</b> water, in which case he could return the leftover wine without ruining the rest, <b>and he is exempt.</b> Drinking that way is considered incidental drinking, and anything that is not a fixed meal is exempt from tithing. That is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> This is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to tithe in both cases.<br><b>And the Rabbis say:</b> There is a distinction between these two cases. When the juice is diluted <b>with hot</b> water, since one cannot return what is left of the juice to the press, <b>he is obligated</b> to tithe it, as this drinking is like fixed drinking for which one is obligated to tithe. However, when the juice is diluted <b>with cold</b> water, <b>he is exempt</b> from tithing it, <b>because he</b> can <b>return the leftover</b> juice to the press. Therefore, it is considered incidental drinking, which is exempt from tithing. The teaching of the mishna: The same applies to a winepress, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, as it teaches that that the leniency to drink without separating tithes applies only if the drinker’s head and most of his body are in the winepress.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> standing in a public domain on Shabbat may <b>catch</b> water in a vessel <b>from a gutter</b> running along the side of a roof, if it is <b>less than ten handbreadths</b> off the ground, which is part of the public domain. <b>And from a pipe</b> that protrudes from the roof, <b>one</b> may <b>drink in any manner,</b> i.e., not only by catching the water in a vessel, but even by pressing his mouth directly against the spout.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> A careful reading of the mishna indicates that to <b>catch, yes,</b> one may catch the water from a distance, <b>but</b> to <b>press</b> his hand or mouth to the gutter, <b>no,</b> that is prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>Rav Naḥman said: Here, we are dealing with a gutter within three</b> handbreadths <b>of the roof,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>anything within three</b> handbreadths <b>of a roof is considered like the roof</b> itself, based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, according to which two solid surfaces are considered joined if there is a gap of less than three handbreadths between them. Since the roof of the house is a private domain, one would be carrying from a private domain to a public domain, which is prohibited.<br><b>That</b> ruling, that there is a distinction between catching water falling from a gutter and pressing one’s hand or mouth to it, <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>stand in a private domain and raise his hand above ten handbreadths,</b> until it is <b>within three</b> handbreadths <b>of the roof, and catch</b> any water falling from his neighbor’s roof in a vessel, <b>provided that he does not press</b> his hand or mouth to the roof.<br><b>It was</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>not stand in a private domain and raise his hand above ten handbreadths, to within three</b> handbreadths <b>of the roof, and press</b> his hand to the gutter, <b>but he</b> may <b>catch</b> water falling from the gutter <b>and drink.</b><br>It was stated in the mishna: <b>But from a pipe one</b> may <b>drink in any manner,</b> as it protrudes more than three handbreadths from the roof. A Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>If the pipe</b> itself <b>is four by four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it is prohibited</b> to stand in the public domain and press one’s hand or mouth to the water, <b>because he is like</b> one who <b>carries from one domain to</b> another <b>domain,</b> as the pipe is considered a domain in its own right.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a cistern in a public domain, with an embankment ten handbreadths high,</b> i.e., the embankment constitutes a private domain by itself, if there is <b>a window above</b> the cistern, i.e., the window of an adjacent house is situated above the cistern, <b>one</b> may <b>draw</b> water <b>from</b> the cistern <b>on Shabbat</b> through the window, as it is permitted to carry from one private domain to another.<br>Similarly, with regard to <b>a garbage dump in a public domain</b> that is <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> which means it has the status of a private domain, if there is <b>a window above</b> the pile of refuse that abuts the garbage dump, <b>one</b> may <b>throw water</b> from the window <b>onto</b> the dump <b>on Shabbat,</b> as it is permitted to carry from one private domain to another.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>With what are we dealing</b> here? <b>If you say</b> we are dealing <b>with</b> a cistern that is <b>adjacent</b> to the wall of the house, i.e. the cistern and wall are separated by less than four handbreadths, <b>why do I</b> need the cistern’s <b>embankment</b> to be <b>ten</b> handbreadths high? Presumably the cistern is ten handbreadths deep, which makes it a private domain, and as it is too close to the house for the public domain to pass between them, one should be permitted to draw water from the cistern through the window, regardless of the height of the embankment.<br><b>Rav Huna said: With what we are dealing here?</b> With a case where the cistern or garbage dump is <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>removed from the wall</b> of the house, i.e., a public domain separates the house from the cistern or heap. It is prohibited to carry from one private domain to another by way of a public domain. However, if the cistern’s embankment is ten handbreadths high, the one drawing the water transfers it by way of an area that is more than ten handbreadths above the public domain, which is an exempt domain.<br><b>And the reason</b> that drawing the water is permitted is <b>that there is an embankment of ten</b> handbreadths; but <b>if there is no embankment of ten</b> handbreadths, it is prohibited, as this would involve <b>moving</b> objects <b>from one private domain to another by way of the public domain.</b><br><b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The above explanation is unnecessary. <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that we are dealing <b>with</b> a cistern that is <b>adjacent</b> to the wall of the house, the mishna comes to <b>teach us that a cistern and its embankment combine to</b> complete the <b>ten</b> handbreadths required for a private domain, and it is not necessary that the embankment itself reach a height of ten handbreadths.<br>The mishna states: With regard to <b>a garbage dump in a public domain</b> that is ten handbreadths high, if there is a window above the heap, one may throw water from the window onto the heap on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>Aren’t we concerned that the</b> entire <b>garbage dump</b> or part of it <b>might be removed,</b> turning the area into a public domain, and people will continue to throw water onto it on Shabbat?<br><b>But didn’t Ravin bar Rav Adda</b> say that <b>Rav Yitzḥak said: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving a certain alleyway, one of whose sides terminated in the sea,</b> which closed it off on one side, <b>and the other side</b> of which <b>terminated in a garbage dump. And the incident came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi for his ruling as to whether the alleyway has the status of an alleyway closed on both sides, <b>and he did not say</b> anything <b>about it, either prohibition or permission.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not say about it</b> that carrying in the alleyway is <b>permitted, as we are concerned lest the garbage dump be removed</b> from its present spot, leaving one side of the alleyway open, <b>and</b> we are likewise concerned that perhaps <b>the sea will throw up sediment</b> and recede. These sedimentary deposits will intervene between the end of the alleyway and the sea, thereby depriving the alleyway of one its partitions.<br>Similarly, <b>he did not say about it</b> that carrying in the alleyway was <b>prohibited, as</b> its <b>partitions,</b> the sea and the garbage dump, indeed <b>exist,</b> and it was certainly permitted at that time to carry in the alleyway. Apparently, there is indeed a concern that a garbage dump might be removed; why, then, does the same concern not apply to the case in the mishna?<br>The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> case, with regard to the alleyway between the garbage dump and the sea, we are concerned, as we are dealing <b>with a private</b> garbage dump, whose owner might change his mind and remove it; whereas in <b>that</b> case, i.e., the case in the mishna, it is referring <b>to a public</b> heap, which will certainly remain fixed in place.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a tree that was hanging over the ground,</b> i.e., its branches hung down on all sides like a tent so that it threw a shadow on the ground, <b>if</b> the tips of <b>its branches are no higher than three handbreadths from the ground, one</b> may <b>carry under it.</b> This applies even if the tree is planted in a public domain, as the branches form partitions which turn the enclosed area into a private domain.<br>If <b>its roots</b> were <b>three handbreadths higher than the ground, one</b> may <b>not sit on them,</b> as it is prohibited to use a tree on Shabbat. Any part of a tree that is three handbreadths above the ground has the status of a tree with regard to this prohibition.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: One</b> may <b>not move</b> objects in the area <b>under</b> the tree if it is <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>. What is the reason</b> for this prohibition?<br><br></body></html>
