Daf 93a<br><br>If one <b>placed roofing on top of a portico that has doorposts,</b> i.e., a portico with two parallel walls that are valid for a <i>sukka</i>, as well as posts in the corners supporting the portico and protruding like doorposts, which are considered as sealing the other two sides of the portico, it is a <b>valid</b> <i>sukka</i>. However, <b>if he evened the doorposts</b> by constructing walls adjacent to the existing walls, obscuring the posts so that they do not protrude, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>invalid.</b> This teaching indicates that the creation of a partition can cause prohibition.<br><b>Abaye said to him: In my opinion,</b> with regard to that case of a portico, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>valid.</b> However, even <b>according to your opinion,</b> this <b>is</b> another instance of <b>the removal of partitions.</b> Evening the doorposts does not render the <i>sukka</i> invalid through the establishment of new partitions, but because it negates the original partitions of the <i>sukka</i>.<br><b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: And didn’t we find</b> that <b>a partition</b> causes <b>prohibition? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a house, half of which is roofed and half unroofed,</b> if there are <b>vines here,</b> under the roofed section of the house, <b>it is permitted to sow</b> crops <b>there,</b> in the open section. The reason is that it is as though the edge of the roof descends to the ground and forms a partition between the two sections of the house.<br><b>And if he evened its roofing,</b> by extending the roof to cover the entire house, it would be <b>prohibited</b> to sow other crops there. It is evident that the very placement of a partition, in this case a roof, causes prohibition. Abaye <b>said to him: There</b> too <b>it is</b> an instance of <b>the removal of partitions.</b> It is prohibited to sow not due to the added roofing; rather, it is prohibited due to the negation of the imaginary partition.<br><b>Rava sent</b> a different proof to <b>Abaye by means of Rav Shemaya bar Ze’eira,</b> with regard to the same issue. <b>And didn’t we find a partition</b> causes <b>prohibition? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is</b> an element <b>in the partitions of a vineyard</b> that causes <b>leniency</b> with regard to diverse kinds of seeds <b>and</b> an element that causes <b>stringency. How so?</b> With regard to <b>a vineyard that is planted until the</b> very <b>base of a partition, one sows</b> crops <b>from the base of</b> the other side of <b>the partition onward.</b> This is a leniency, <b>as were there no partition there,</b> he would be required to <b>distance</b> himself <b>four cubits</b> from the last vine <b>and</b> only then <b>sow</b> there. <b>And this is</b> an element in <b>partitions of a vineyard</b> that causes <b>leniency.</b><br><b>And</b> as for an element in partitions that causes <b>stringency, how so?</b> If the vineyard <b>was distanced eleven cubits from a wall, one may not bring</b> the <b>seeds</b> of other crops <b>there,</b> between the vineyard and the wall, and sow that area. This is a stringency, <b>as were there no partition,</b> it would suffice to <b>distance</b> himself <b>four cubits</b> from the last vine, <b>and sow</b> there. <b>This is</b> an element of <b>partitions in a vineyard</b> that causes <b>stringency,</b> a clear situation of a partition that causes prohibition.<br>Abaye <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning</b> that this presents a difficulty, <b>raise an objection against our</b> opinion <b>from a mishna,</b> rather than a less authoritative <i>baraita</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a clearing in a vineyard, Beit Shammai say:</b> Its measure is <b>twenty-four cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Sixteen cubits.</b> With regard to <b>the perimeter of a vineyard, Beit Shammai say: Sixteen cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Twelve cubits.</b><br>The mishna explains: <b>And what is a clearing in a vineyard?</b> It is referring to <b>a vineyard whose middle</b> section <b>was laid bare</b> of vines. If <b>there are not sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there,</b> due to the Torah prohibition against sowing other crops in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). If <b>there were sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one provides</b> the vineyard with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> i.e., four cubits along either side of the vines are left unsown to facilitate cultivation of the vines, <b>and he sows the rest</b> of the cleared area with foreign crops.<br>The mishna continues: <b>What is the perimeter of a vineyard?</b> It is the vacant area <b>between the vineyard and the fence</b> surrounding it. If <b>there are not twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there.</b> If <b>there are twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>he provides</b> the vineyard with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> four cubits, <b>and he sows the rest.</b> However, were the vineyard not surrounded by a fence, all he would need to do is distance himself four cubits from the last vine. It is clear from this <i>halakha</i> that the partition causes prohibition.<br><b>Rather,</b> the objection was not raised from there because <b>there, isn’t this the reason</b> that the partition is not considered to cause prohibition? It is <b>because the entire</b> area of <b>four cubits alongside a vineyard is</b> considered <b>the vineyard’s work area,</b> and is therefore an actual part of it. Likewise, with regard to the four cubits <b>alongside the fence</b> surrounding the vineyard, <b>since they cannot</b> easily <b>be sown</b> due to the wall, <b>he renounces ownership over</b> the area. With regard to the space <b>in between, if it is four</b> cubits, <b>it is</b> deemed <b>significant</b> in its own right, <b>and if not, it is not significant</b> and is nullified relative to the rest, and it is prohibited to sow there. A similar reasoning applies to the <i>baraita</i>. The stringency is not due to the fact that the partition causes prohibition, but because the partition impedes cultivation of the vineyard.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If there are <b>three enclosures alongside one another, and the two outer</b> ones <b>protrude,</b> i.e., they are wider than the middle one, so that there are partitions on both sides of the breach between them and the middle enclosure, <b>and the middle one does not protrude,</b> and there are no partitions between it and the outer enclosures, as it is totally breached, <b>and there is one</b> person <b>in this</b> one <b>and one</b> person <b>in that</b> one and yet another person in the third enclosure, the people in the enclosures are considered as though they are all living in one large enclosure. Consequently, the legal status of the group <b>becomes like</b> that of <b>a caravan, and one provides them</b> with <b>all</b> the space <b>that they require.</b> In other words, they may use the entire enclosure even if it is very large, just as there are no limits to the size of the enclosed area in which members of a caravan may carry.<br>However, if the <b>middle</b> enclosure <b>protruded, and the two outer ones did not protrude,</b> i.e., they were narrower than the middle enclosure, so that their entire width was breached into it, <b>and there is one</b> person <b>in this</b> one <b>and one</b> person <b>in that</b> one and yet another in the third, <b>one provides them only</b> an area of <b>six <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of individuals in a field, who may enclose an area of only two <i>beit se’a</i> per person. As the middle enclosure is larger than the two outer ones, it determines their status, in accordance with the principle stated above, not the other way around. Consequently, the person in the middle enclosure is regarded as though he established residence in only one of the outer enclosures, constituting a group of no more than two, which does not have the legal status of a caravan.<br>Based on these assumptions, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If there is <b>one</b> person <b>in this</b> outer enclosure, <b>and one person in the other</b> outer enclosure, <b>and two</b> people <b>in the middle</b> enclosure, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the ruling that <b>if</b> the pair <b>exit to here,</b> one of the outer enclosures, <b>they are three</b> people in one place, <b>and if they exit to there,</b> the other outer enclosure, <b>they are three</b> people in one place, and three people are considered a caravan and provided with all the space they require, as stated above?<br><b>Or perhaps,</b> as <b>one may exit to here and the other may exit to there,</b> in which case there would be no more than two people in each enclosure, they are provided with only two <i>beit se’a</i> per person.<br><b>And if you say</b> that <b>one may exit to here and one may exit to there,</b> if there were <b>two</b> people <b>in this</b> outer enclosure, <b>and two</b> people <b>in that</b> outer enclosure, <b>and one</b> person <b>in the middle</b> enclosure, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is the ruling that <b>here, certainly, if he exits to here they are three, and if he exits to there they are</b> likewise <b>three,</b> and consequently they should be provided with all the space they require in any case? <b>Or perhaps,</b> in this case too there is uncertainty, as <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> might <b>exit to here, and say</b> that <b>he</b> might <b>exit to there.</b> As the direction in which he will leave his enclosure is undetermined, they should be provided with only two <i>beit se’a</i> each.<br>These dilemmas were essentially left unresolved, <b>but</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>these dilemmas</b> are decided <b>leniently, and</b> they are provided with all the space they require in these cases.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b><br><br>Daf 93b<br><br><b>An embankment,</b> a height disparity between two surfaces <b>of five</b> handbreadths, <b>and</b> an additional <b>partition of five</b> handbreadths <b>do not join</b> together to form a partition of ten handbreadths, the minimum height for a partition to enclose a private domain. It is regarded as a partition of ten handbreadths <b>only if</b> the barrier <b>is</b> composed <b>entirely of the embankment or if it is</b> composed <b>entirely of a partition.</b><br><b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If there were <b>two courtyards, one above the other, and</b> the <b>upper one was ten handbreadths higher than the lower one, or if it had an embankment of five</b> handbreadths <b>and a partition</b> of <b>five</b> handbreadths, the two courtyards are considered separate domains <b>and they establish two <i>eiruvin</i>,</b> one for each courtyard, <b>and they do not establish one <i>eiruv</i>.</b> If the height disparity was <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, the two areas are considered a single domain, and <b>they establish one <i>eiruv</i> and they do not establish two <i>eiruvin</i>.</b><br><b>Rav said: Rav Ḥisda concedes</b> that an embankment and a partition combine <b>with regard to the lower</b> courtyard, <b>since it faces a wall of ten,</b> i.e., there is a full partition of ten handbreadths before its residents. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> according to this reasoning, the residents of the <b>lower</b> courtyard, from whose perspective there is a valid partition, should <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i>,</b> i.e., an independent <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and do not establish one <i>eiruv</i></b> together with the upper courtyard, while the residents of <b>the upper</b> courtyard <b>establish neither one <i>eiruv</i> nor two.</b> The residents of the upper courtyard neither establish an <i>eiruv</i> on their own, as it is breached into the lower one, nor can they establish an <i>eiruv</i> together with the lower courtyard, because the latter is separated from it.<br><b>Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the <b>upper</b> courtyard had full-fledged ten-handbreadth-high walls that <b>protruded</b> on both sides of the section of the partition that was merely five handbreadths high, a protrusion that extended <b>up to ten cubits.</b> In this case, the upper courtyard is properly enclosed by a partition ten handbreadths high, while the section that is only five handbreadths high is deemed an entrance. Consequently, even the residents of the upper courtyard can establish an <i>eiruv</i> on their own. But the two courtyards cannot be merged by a single <i>eiruv</i>, because the lower courtyard is enclosed by a partition from which there is no entrance to the upper courtyard.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: If the height disparity was <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, <b>they</b> are considered a single domain, and the residents therefore <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>, but they do not establish two <i>eiruvin</i>.</b> According to the explanation suggested above, that there is a partition ten handbreadths high between the courtyards with an entrance of sorts between them, <b>if they wish, they establish one <i>eiruv</i>,</b> and <b>if they wish, they establish two <i>eiruvin</i>.</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> in a case of two courtyards with an entrance between them.<br><b>Rabba, son of Rava, said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> refers to a case <b>where the lower</b> courtyard <b>was fully breached into the upper one,</b> i.e., the gap in the wall spanned the entire width of the lower courtyard. In that case, the residents of the lower courtyard establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> with the upper courtyard; however, they may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> of their own, in accordance with the mishna in which we learned that if a large courtyard is breached into a smaller one, it is permitted for the residents of the large courtyard to carry, but it is prohibited for the residents of the small one to do so.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be that the residents of the <b>lower</b> courtyard <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i></b> together with the upper one, but they <b>do not establish two <i>eiruvin</i>,</b> i.e., the residents cannot establish an independent <i>eiruv</i> for their courtyard. However, with regard to <b>the upper one, if</b> its residents <b>wish,</b> they <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i></b> together with the lower courtyard, and <b>if</b> they <b>wish,</b> they <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i>.</b> The residents of the upper courtyard can establish an independent <i>eiruv</i> for their courtyard, as the larger courtyard renders it prohibited for the residents of the smaller courtyard to carry, but not vice versa.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> that is the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And when</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> If the height disparity was <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, the residents <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>, but they do not establish two <i>eiruvin</i>,</b> this statement is not referring to both courtyards, but only <b>to the lower</b> one.<br><b>Mareimar taught: An embankment of five</b> handbreadths <b>and an</b> additional <b>partition of five</b> handbreadths above it <b>combine</b> to form a partition of ten handbreadths. <b>Ravina met Rav Aḥa, son of Rava,</b> and <b>said to him:</b> Has <b>the Master taught anything with regard to</b> this <b>partition,</b> whether it is effective or not? <b>He said to him: No.</b> The Gemara concludes: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>an embankment of five</b> handbreadths <b>and a partition of five</b> handbreadths <b>combine</b> to form an effective partition of ten handbreadths.<br><b>Rav Hoshaya raised a dilemma:</b> What is the ruling with regard to <b>residents who arrive on Shabbat,</b> i.e., who join the residents of a courtyard on Shabbat, e.g., if the wall between two courtyards collapsed on Shabbat so that new residents arrive in one courtyard from the other. Had these people arrived before Shabbat they would have rendered it prohibited for the residents to carry in the courtyard unless they participated with the original residents in their <i>eiruv</i>. <b>Do</b> these residents <b>render it prohibited</b> for the original residents to carry in the courtyard, even if they arrive on Shabbat itself?<br><b>Rav Ḥisda said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from the mishna: With regard to <b>a large courtyard that was breached into a small</b> courtyard, it is <b>permitted</b> for the residents of <b>the large</b> courtyard to carry, but it is <b>prohibited</b> for the residents of <b>the small</b> one to do so. It is permitted to carry in the large courtyard <b>because</b> the breach <b>is</b> regarded <b>like the entrance of the large</b> courtyard. Apparently, even if the breach occurred on Shabbat, it is prohibited for the residents of the small courtyard to carry. <b>Rabba said: Say</b> that the mishna is dealing with a case where <b>it was breached while it was still day,</b> i.e., on Friday. However, there is no prohibition if the breach occurred on Shabbat itself.<br><b>Abaye said to him: The Master should not state: Say,</b> indicating that it is possible to explain the mishna in this manner. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is <b>certainly</b> referring to a case where the courtyard <b>was breached while it was still day. As Master,</b> you <b>are the one who said: I raised a dilemma before Rav Huna, and I raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda:</b> If one <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> to join one courtyard to another <b>via</b> a certain <b>opening, and that opening was sealed</b> on Shabbat, or if one established an <i>eiruv</i> <b>via</b> a certain <b>window, and that window was sealed</b> on Shabbat, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May one continue to rely on this <i>eiruv</i> and carry from one courtyard to the other via other entrances? <b>And he said to me: Once</b> it <b>was permitted</b> to carry from courtyard to courtyard at the onset of <b>Shabbat, it was permitted</b> and remains so until the conclusion of Shabbat. According to this principle, if a breach that adds residents occurs on Shabbat, the breach does not render prohibited activities that were permitted when Shabbat began.<br><b>It is stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed: With regard to <b>a wall between two courtyards,</b> whose residents did not establish a joint <i>eiruv</i>, <b>that collapsed</b> on Shabbat, <b>Rav said: One may carry in</b> the joint courtyard <b>only within four cubits,</b> as carrying in each courtyard is prohibited due to the other, because they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> together. Rav does not accept the principle that an activity that was permitted at the start of Shabbat remains permitted until the conclusion of Shabbat.<br><b>And Shmuel said:</b><br><br></body></html>
