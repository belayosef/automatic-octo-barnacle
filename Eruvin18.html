Daf 18a<br><br><b>to distance</b> the boards from the well and expand the enclosed area by <b>any amount,</b> i.e., as much as one wishes, <b>provided that he increases the</b> number of upright <b>boards</b> between the double posts. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The partitioned area may be expanded <b>up to</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> which is an area of five thousand square cubits.<br>The Rabbis <b>said to him: They only spoke of</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> with regard to a garden or an enclosure</b> used for storing wood, scrap, and the like <b>[<i>karpef</i>]. But if it was a pen [<i>dir</i>], or a stable [<i>sahar</i>], or a backyard, or a courtyard</b> in front of the house, <b>even</b> if it had an area of <b>five <i>beit kor</i></b> or <b>even ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permitted. And it is permitted to distance</b> the boards and expand the enclosed area <b>by any amount, provided that one increases the</b> upright <b>boards</b> between the double posts.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may arrange</b> upright <b>boards around a</b> water <b>cistern and ropes around a caravan. Ḥananya</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> One may set up <b>ropes for a cistern, but not</b> upright <b>boards.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, a cistern</b> of collected rain water has a <b>discrete</b> law, as the water will eventually be consumed and the upright boards will become unnecessary; and <b>a well</b> of spring <b>water</b> has a <b>discrete</b> law, as the water is constantly renewed and the upright boards will remain useful.<br><b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous passage: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach: Ḥananya says: One may set up ropes around</b> a water <b>cistern and boards around a well, by inference, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, there is no difference between a cistern and a well.</b> In both cases, <b>ropes</b> are <b>indeed</b> permitted, whereas upright <b>boards are not. Let us say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya,</b> he was only replying <b>to that which the first <i>tanna</i> had said;</b> since the first <i>tanna</i> had spoken only of a cistern, there was no need for Ḥananya to fully clarify his own position and distinguish between a cistern and a well.<br>The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let us say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As we learned</b> in a mishna: In <b>each of</b> the cases of <b>a public well, a public cistern, and a private well, one may arrange</b> upright <b>boards for them, but</b> in the case of <b>a private cistern, one must establish</b> a proper <b>partition for it ten handbreadths high;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b><br><b>Whereas here</b> in the mishna <b>it teaches:</b> One may arrange upright boards <b>for a well,</b> from which one may infer that <b>for a well, yes,</b> it is permitted to use posts, but <b>for a cistern, no,</b> it is not permitted. This is opposed to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, which maintains that posts may be arranged for a public cistern.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument as well: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a well of spring water, which he</b> can teach in <b>a distinct</b> manner because <b>there is no difference</b> whether it belongs to <b>the public and there is no difference</b> whether it belongs <b>to an individual,</b> as it is always permitted. However, <b>he did not teach</b> the case of <b>a cistern</b> containing <b>collected</b> rain water, <b>which he</b> could <b>not</b> teach in a <b>distinct</b> manner because there is a difference between a public cistern and a private one. However, it cannot be proven from here that he disagrees with Rabbi Akiva.<br>The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let us say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava says: One may only arrange</b> upright <b>boards for a public well, whereas here</b> the mishna <b>states: For wells.</b> The plural term implies that <b>there is no difference</b> if the well belongs to <b>the public, and there is no difference</b> if the well belongs <b>to an individual.</b><br>The Gemara also rejects this line of reasoning: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava,</b> to <b>what</b> is the mishna referring when it says <b>wells?</b> It is referring to <b>wells in general,</b> but the <i>tanna</i> means to include only public wells.<br>The mishna had mentioned double posts [<i>deyomadin</i>]: The Gemara asks: <b>What are <i>deyomadin</i>? Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: Two [<i>deyo</i>] posts [<i>amudin</i>],</b> which are put together to create a single corner piece.<br>Having cited Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar’s statement with reference to the prefix <i>deyo</i>, the Gemara cites other statements of his. <b>Two, to</b> one who was <b>ostracized, praise, nourishment, ruin, attribute, three,</b> are <b>mnemonics</b> for the following statements by Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar.<br><b>We learned there</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: All inferior figs are exempt</b> from being tithed, even if they are of doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>], as even if the seller is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, he must certainly have already separated tithes from them, since the loss incurred by tithing is negligible, <b>except for <i>deyufra</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>deyufra</i>? Ulla said: A tree that yields two [<i>deyo</i>]</b> harvests <b>of fruit [<i>peirot</i>] each year.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: Adam</b> was first created with <b>two [<i>deyo</i>] faces,</b> one male and the other female. <b>As it is stated: “You have formed me behind and before,</b> and laid Your hand upon me” (Psalms 139:5). Similarly, <b>it is written: “And the <i>tzela</i>, which</b> the Lord, God, had taken from the man, <b>He made</b> a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Genesis 2:22). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree over the meaning of the word <i>tzela</i>: <b>One said:</b> It means a female <b>face,</b> from which God created Eve; <b>and one said:</b> Adam was created with <b>a tail [<i>zanav</i>],</b> which God removed from him and from which He created Eve.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <i>tzela</i> means <b>face;</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “You have formed me [<i>tzartani</i>] behind and before.” However, according to the one who says</b> that <i>tzela</i> means <b>tail, what is</b> meant by the verse: <b>“You have formed me [<i>tzartani</i>] behind and before”?</b><br>The Gemara answers that this verse is to be understood as bearing a moral message, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami said: Behind</b> means Adam was created at the end of <b>the act of creation; and before</b> means that he was first <b>for punishment.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is understandable that Adam was <b>behind,</b> or last, <b>in the act of creation,</b> meaning that <b>he was not created until</b> the sixth day, <b>Shabbat eve. However, before,</b> or first, <b>for punishment, what</b> does <b>this</b> mean? <b>If you say</b> that he was punished first <b>because of the curse</b> pronounced in the wake of the sin involving the Tree of Knowledge, there is a difficulty. <b>Wasn’t the snake was cursed first, and afterward Eve was cursed, and</b> only <b>at the end was Adam cursed?</b><br><b>Rather,</b> this refers <b>to</b> the punishment of the <b>Flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle,</b> creeping things and fowl of the heaven” (Genesis 7:23). This indicates that the punishment began with man.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was originally <b>a face</b> or side of Adam; it is understandable <b>that it is written:</b> “Then the Lord God <b>formed [<i>vayyitzer</i>]</b> man” (Genesis 2:7). <i>Vayyitzer</i> is written with <b>a double <i>yod</i>,</b> one for Adam and one for Eve. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> conveyed by spelling <b><i>vayyitzer</i></b> with a double <i>yod</i>?<br>The Gemara responds: This is interpreted homiletically, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, as Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said:</b> This comes to emphasize that which one says to himself in every circumstance: <b>Woe unto me from my</b> evil <b>inclination [<i>yetzer</i>]</b> if I perform the will of my Maker, <b>and woe to me from my Maker [<i>Yotzri</i>]</b> if I perform the will of my inclination.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was <b>a face,</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “Male and female, He created them,</b> and blessed them, and called their name Man in the day when they were created” (Genesis 5:2), which indicates that from the very beginning of their creation, He fashioned two faces, one for the male and the other for the female. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Male and female, He created them”?</b><br>The Gemara answers: It can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu raised a contradiction</b> between the verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them,”</b> in the plural, <b>and</b> on the other hand <b>it is written:</b> “So God created man in His own image, <b>for in the image of God He created him”</b> (Genesis 1:27), in the singular. <b>At first, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, and ultimately, only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was <b>a face,</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written:</b> “And He took one of his sides <b>and closed up the flesh in its place”</b> (Genesis 2:21). <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> meant by the verse: <b>“And He closed up the flesh in its place”?</b><br><b>Rav Zevid said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: It was necessary</b> to say that the fleshed closed up <b>only with regard to the place of the incision.</b><br>The Gemara challenges the other opinion: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail;</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “And</b> the Lord God <b>built</b> the <i>tzela</i>” (Genesis 2:22), as it was a completely new building. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a complete <b>face</b> or side, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And He built”?</b> What needed to be built?<br>The Gemara responds: This must be interpreted homiletically, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, as Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya interpreted homiletically</b> the verse: <b>“And the Lord God built the <i>tzela</i>.”</b> This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, braided for Eve</b> her hair, <b>and</b> then <b>brought her to Adam, as in the coastal towns, they call braiding</b> hair <b>building.</b><br><b>Alternatively,</b> the verse: <b>“And the Lord God built,”</b> can be understood as a description of Eve’s basic shape, as <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, built Eve like the structure</b><br><br>Daf 18b<br><br><b>of a storehouse. Just as a storehouse is</b> built <b>wide on the bottom and narrow on top, in order to hold produce</b> without collapsing, <b>so too a woman</b> is created <b>wide on the bottom and narrow on top, in order to hold the fetus.</b><br>The Gemara cites an exposition of the end of the previously cited verse: <b>“And brought her unto the man”</b> (Genesis 2:22). This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, was Adam the first</b> man’s <b>best man,</b> attending to all his wedding needs and bringing his wife to him. <b>From here</b> we learn <b>that a greater individual should serve as a best man for a lesser individual and should not feel bad</b> about it as something beneath his dignity.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that Eve was <b>a face</b> or side of Adam, <b>which one of them walked in front? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is reasonable</b> to say <b>that the male walked in front,</b> as this is proper behavior, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A man should not walk behind a woman on a path, even if she is his wife. If she happens</b> upon him <b>on a bridge, he should</b> walk quickly in order to catch up to her and consequently <b>move her to</b> his <b>side,</b> so that she will not walk before him. <b>And anyone who walks behind a woman in a river,</b> where she has to lift up her skirt in order to cross, <b>has no share in the World-to-Come.</b><br><b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who counts out money for a woman from his hand into her hand or from her hand into his hand, in order to look upon her, even if</b> in other matters <b>he is like Moses our teacher, who received the Torah from Mount Sinai, he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna. The verse says about him: “Hand to hand, the evil man shall not go unpunished”</b> (Proverbs 11:21). One who hands money from his hand to her hand, even if he received the Torah from God’s hand to his own, like Moses, <b>he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna,</b> which is called evil.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> From the following verse, it is known that Samson’s father, <b>Manoah, was an ignoramus, as it is stated: “And Manoah arose, and went after his wife”</b> (Judges 13:11), which shows that he was unfamiliar with the principle that one must not walk behind a woman.<br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak strongly objects to this: If that is so,</b> if the verse relating to Manoah is understood literally, what will one say about the verse <b>with regard to Elkana,</b> the father of the prophet Samuel, <b>as it is written: “And Elkana walked after his wife.”</b> Does <b>this</b> verse mean that Elkana was <b>also</b> an ignorant person? <b>And</b> what of the verse <b>with regard to</b> the prophet <b>Elisha, as it is written:</b> “And the mother of the child said: As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you; <b>and he arose and followed her”</b> (ii Kings 4:30). Does <b>this</b> verse mean that Elisha was <b>also</b> an uneducated person?<br><b>Rather,</b> certainly each of these verses means that <b>he followed her words and advice.</b> If so, <b>here too,</b> the verse concerning Manoah may be similarly interpreted. He did not literally walk behind his wife, but rather <b>he followed</b> her <b>words and advice.</b><br><b>Rav Ashi said: And according to what Rav Naḥman said,</b> that <b>Manoah was an ignoramus, he did not even read</b> the basic Torah stories that children learn <b>in school. As it is written: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man”</b> (Genesis 24:61); they followed him and did <b>not</b> walk <b>before the man.</b><br>On this topic, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is preferable to walk <b>behind a lion, and not behind a woman.</b> And it is preferable to walk <b>behind a woman and not behind idolatry.</b> When a procession honoring idolatry is passing in the street, it is better to walk behind a woman than appear to be accompanying the idolatry. It is preferable to walk <b>behind idolatry and not behind a synagogue at a time of prayer.</b> By walking behind a synagogue at a time of prayer and not entering, one appears as though he were denying the God to Whom the congregation is directing its prayers.<br>Having cited an aggadic statement of Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar, the Gemara cites other statements of his: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: All those years during which Adam was ostracized</b> for the sin involving the Tree of Knowledge, <b>he bore spirits, demons, and female demons, as it is stated: “And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image,</b> and called his name Seth” (Genesis 5:3). <b>By inference, until now,</b> the age of one hundred thirty, <b>he did not bear after his image,</b> but rather bore other creatures.<br>The Gemara raises <b>an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Adam the first</b> man <b>was very pious. When he saw that death was imposed as a punishment because of him, he observed a fast for a hundred thirty years, and he separated from</b> his <b>wife for a hundred thirty years, and wore belts [<i>zarzei</i>] of fig</b> leaves <b>on his body</b> as his only garment for <b>a hundred thirty years.</b> If so, how did he father demons into the world?<br>The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>made his statement,</b> he meant that those destructive creatures were formed <b>from the semen that</b> Adam <b>accidentally emitted,</b> which brought the destructive creatures into being.<br><b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> further <b>said:</b> Only <b>some of a person’s praise should be said in his presence, and all of it</b> may be said <b>not in his presence.</b> Only <b>some of his praise should be said in his presence, as it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Noah, come, you and all your house into the ark, <b>for you have I seen righteous before Me in this generation”</b> (Genesis 7:1).<br><b>And all of it</b> may be said <b>not in his presence, as it is written:</b> “These are the generations of Noah; <b>Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations,</b> and Noah walked with God” (Genesis 6:9). When not referring to him in his presence, God refers to Noah as a righteous and perfect man.<br><b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the dove came in to him in the evening, <b>and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf, plucked off [<i>taraf</i>];</b> so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth” (Genesis 8:11)? <b>The dove said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, let my food be bitter as an olive but given into Your hand, and let it not be sweet as honey but dependent upon flesh and blood.</b> He adds this explanation: <b>Here it is written: <i>Taraf</i>. And there it is written:</b> “Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; <b>feed me [<i>hatrifeni</i>] my allotted portion”</b> (Proverbs 30:8).<br><b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: Any house in which the words of Torah are heard at night will never be destroyed, as it is stated: “But none says: Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night”</b> (Job 35:10). The verse implies that one who sings songs of Torah in his house at night will not need to lament the destruction of his home.<br><b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> further <b>said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, it is enough for the world to use</b> in its praise of God, or in greeting one another with the name of God, only <b>two letters</b> of the Tetragrammaton, namely <i>yod</i> and <i>heh</i>, <b>as it is stated: “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord [<i>Yah</i>]. <i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 150:6), without mentioning the full name of God, comprised of four letters.<br><b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said:</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it. When <b>Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed.</b> He explains: When <b>Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed, as it is written: “I will also make it a possession for wild birds, and pools of water”</b> (Isaiah 14:23), and the arrival of predatory animals brings harm to the surrounding neighbors as well. When <b>Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed, as it is written: “Therefore I will turn Samaria into a heap of rubble in the field</b><br><br></body></html>
