Daf 40a<br><br><b>rather,</b> it had already been caught beforehand, but it <b>came</b> to the Exilarch’s house on the Festival <b>from outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit</b> and was slaughtered on that day. <b>The one</b> who <b>ate</b> from it, namely, Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda, <b>holds:</b> Something <b>that comes</b> from outside the Shabbat limit <b>for one Jew is permitted to another Jew.</b> Since the deer was brought for the Exilarch, the Sages at his table were permitted to eat from it, and we do not prohibit them to derive benefit from something that a gentile did for another Jew.<br><b>And the one</b> who <b>did not eat</b> from it, Rav Sheshet, <b>holds: Anything that comes to the house of the Exilarch comes with all the Sages in mind,</b> as it is known that the Exilarch invites them to dine with him on Festivals. Therefore, just as it was prohibited to the Exilarch himself, as it was brought from outside the Shabbat limit, so too, it was prohibited to all his guests.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rav Sheshet meet Rabba bar Shmuel and say to him</b> what he said, indicating that the issue is related to the question of whether the two days are considered distinct sanctities? The Gemara answers: According to Ameimar’s version of the story, <b>that</b> encounter <b>never happened.</b><br>The Gemara relates that a delivery of <b>turnip</b> was once <b>brought to</b> the town of <b>Meḥoza</b> by gentile merchants from outside the Shabbat limit on a Festival in the Diaspora. <b>Rava went out</b> to the market and <b>saw</b> that the turnips <b>were withered, and</b> therefore <b>he permitted</b> people <b>to buy them</b> immediately without having to wait the amount of time needed to bring similar items from outside the limit after the Festival. <b>He said: These</b> turnips <b>were</b> certainly <b>uprooted</b> from the ground <b>yesterday,</b> and no prohibited labor was performed with them today.<br><b>What</b> might <b>you say;</b> that <b>they came from outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit</b> and should therefore be prohibited? The accepted principle is: Something <b>that comes for one Jew is permitted to be eaten by another Jew, and all the more so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> delivery of turnip, <b>which came with gentiles in mind,</b> i.e., for their sake rather than for the sake of Jews. Therefore, if they are purchased by Jews, no prohibition is violated.<br>The Gemara adds: <b>Once</b> Rava <b>saw that</b> the gentile merchants started to <b>bring increased</b> quantities of turnips on Festival days for the sake of their Jewish customers, <b>he prohibited</b> the inhabitants of Meḥoza to buy them, for it was evident that they were now being brought for Jews.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>certain canopy makers,</b> who would braid myrtle branches into their canopies, once <b>cut myrtles on the second day of a Festival,</b> and <b>in the evening Ravina permitted</b> people <b>to smell them immediately</b> at the conclusion of the Festival. <b>Rava bar Taḥalifa said to Ravina: The Master should prohibit them</b> to do this, <b>as they are not knowledgeable in Torah,</b> and therefore we should be stringent with them lest they come to treat the sanctity of the second Festival day lightly.<br><b>Rav Shemaya strongly objects to this: The reason</b> given here is <b>that they are not knowledgeable in Torah;</b> but if <b>they were knowledgeable in Torah, would it be permitted? Don’t we require</b> them to wait <b>the time needed for</b> the myrtle’s <b>preparation,</b> i.e., the time it takes to cut them? <b>They went and asked Rava. He said to them: We require</b> them to wait <b>the time needed for</b> the myrtle’s <b>preparation.</b><br>The mishna cited Rabbi Dosa’s version of the Rosh HaShana prayer: <b>Rabbi Dosa says: He who passes before the ark</b> and leads the congregation in prayer on the first day of the festival of Rosh HaShana says: Strengthen us, O Lord our God, on this day of the New Moon, whether it is today or tomorrow.<br><b>Rabba said: When we were in the house</b> of study <b>of Rav Huna, we raised the</b> following <b>dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether it is proper <b>to mention the New Moon</b> during prayer <b>on Rosh HaShana?</b> The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: Do we say that <b>since they have separate additional offerings,</b> as one additional offering is brought for the New Moon and another for Rosh HaShana, <b>we mention</b> them separately in prayer as well? <b>Or perhaps one remembrance counts for</b> both <b>this and that?</b> The Torah is referring to both Rosh HaShana and the New Moon as times of remembrance, and therefore perhaps simply mentioning that it is a Day of Remembrance should suffice.<br>Rav Huna <b>said to us: You have</b> already <b>learned</b> the answer to this question in the mishna, which states that <b>Rabbi Dosa says: He who passes before the ark</b> and leads the congregation in prayer on the first day and on the second day of Rosh HaShana mentions the New Moon in a conditional manner: On this day of the New Moon, whether it is today or tomorrow. But the Rabbis did not agree with him. <b>What, is it not</b> that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Dosa about the need <b>to mention</b> the New Moon during prayer on Rosh HaShana?<br>The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>No,</b> they disagree about whether <b>to make a condition.</b> The novelty in Rabbi Dosa’s teaching was not that mention must be made of the New Moon, but that a condition must be made due to the day’s uncertain status. The Rabbis disagree about that.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say that the dispute between Rabbi Dosa and the Rabbis relates to the condition and not to the very mention of the New Moon. This can be ascertained <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: And so too, Rabbi Dosa would do</b> this <b>on</b> all <b>the New Moons</b> for which two days are kept out of doubt <b>the entire year; and</b> the Rabbis <b>did not agree with him.</b><br><b>Granted, if you say</b> that the disagreement was about whether <b>to make a condition, that is why they did not agree with him</b> with regard to the New Moon throughout the year, as they did not accept the whole idea of a conditional prayer. <b>But if you say</b> the main point of contention was whether <b>to mention</b> the New Moon at all, <b>why didn’t they agree with him</b> that the New Moon should be mentioned during prayer the rest of the year?<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> is the disagreement about, whether or not <b>to make a condition? Why do I</b> need them <b>to disagree in two</b> cases? The issue is the same on Rosh HaShana as on any other New Moon. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach both cases, <b>as, if he had</b> only <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>Rosh HaShana, I might have said</b> that only <b>in this</b> case <b>did the Rabbis say that one should not</b> mention the New Moon in a conditional manner <b>because people might come to demean</b> the day and perform prohibited labor. <b>But in</b> the case of an ordinary <b>New Moon throughout the year,</b> I might <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>they agree with Rabbi Dosa,</b> since labor is not prohibited on the New Moon, and therefore there is no reason for concern lest people come to treat it lightly.<br><b>And if</b> the disagreement <b>had</b> only <b>been stated in this</b> case, in the case of an ordinary New Moon, one might say that only <b>in this</b> case <b>did Rabbi Dosa say</b> that a condition may be made. <b>But in that</b> other case of Rosh HaShana, I might <b>say</b> that <b>he agrees with the Rabbis,</b> due to concern lest people will come to treat the Festival lightly. It was therefore <b>necessary</b> to state the disagreement in both cases.<br>The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on the <i>Tosefta</i> that states that in the case of <b>Rosh HaShana that occurs on Shabbat, Beit Shammai say: One prays</b> an <i>Amida</i> that contains <b>ten</b> blessings, including the nine blessings ordinarily recited on Rosh HaShana and an additional blessing in which Shabbat is mentioned. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One prays</b> an <i>Amida</i> that contains <b>nine</b> blessings, as Shabbat and the Festival are mentioned in the same blessing. <b>And if there were</b> an opinion that held that the New Moon must be separately mentioned in the Rosh HaShana prayer, then <b>it should</b> say that according to <b>Beit Shammai,</b> one must recite <b>eleven</b> blessings, i.e., nine for Rosh HaShana, one for Shabbat, and one for the New Moon.<br><br>Daf 40b<br><br><b>Rabbi Zeira said: The New Moon is different,</b> for while it must indeed be mentioned according to Beit Shammai, it does not require a separate blessing. <b>Since</b> the New Moon <b>is included</b> in the regular <b>morning and evening</b> prayers without a separate blessing, <b>it is included in the additional</b> prayer <b>as well</b> without a separate blessing.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And do Beit Shammai</b> accept the view that one should <b>include</b> the New Moon in the regular prayer? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>a New Moon that occurs on Shabbat, Beit Shammai say: One</b> must <b>pray</b> an <i>Amida</i> that includes <b>eight</b> blessings in the additional prayer, including a separate blessing for the New Moon; <b>and Beit Hillel say: One must pray</b> an <i>Amida</i> that includes <b>seven</b> blessings, as Shabbat and the New Moon are mentioned in the same blessing? Therefore, according to Beit Shammai, we do not include the New Moon and other days in the same blessing, and the fact that the New Moon does not have its own blessing on Rosh HaShana is because one mention of remembrance counts for both Rosh HaShana and New Moon. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <b>difficult.</b><br>The Gemara comments: The issue of whether or not one should <b>include</b> the mention of the New Moon in the blessing pertaining to the sanctity of the day of Shabbat is <b>itself</b> the subject of a dispute between the <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a <b>Shabbat that occurs on a New Moon or on</b> one of <b>the intermediate days of a Festival:</b> For <b>the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers, one prays in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> and recites <b>seven</b> blessings, <b>and says</b> a passage pertaining to the <b>event</b> of the day, i.e. May there rise and come [<i>ya’aleh veyavo</i>], <b>during</b> the blessing of <b>Temple service. Rabbi Eliezer</b> disagrees and <b>says</b> that this passage is said <b>during</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving. And if he did not recite</b> it, <b>we require him to return</b> to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it.<br><b>And in the additional prayer, one begins</b> the fourth blessing, the special blessing for the additional service, <b>with Shabbat, and concludes</b> it <b>with Shabbat, and says</b> a passage referring to <b>the sanctity of the day</b> of the New Moon or the Festival <b>in the middle.</b> Therefore, only in the additional prayer is the New Moon included in the blessing for the sanctity of the day.<br>On the other hand, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, say: Wherever</b> one is <b>obligated</b> to recite <b>seven</b> blessings, including the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers, <b>he begins</b> the fourth blessing <b>with Shabbat and concludes</b> it <b>with Shabbat, and he says</b> a passage referring to <b>the sanctity of the day</b> of the New Moon or the Festival <b>in the middle.</b> In their opinion, the New Moon is included in the blessing of the sanctity of the day in all the prayers of the day.<br>Returning to the fundamental question of whether the New Moon must be mentioned separately on Rosh HaShana, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about this</b> issue? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: One</b> mention of <b>remembrance counts for</b> both <b>this and that. And so too, Rabba said: One</b> mention of <b>remembrance counts for</b> both <b>this and that.</b><br>Having discussed the Rosh HaShana prayers, the Gemara addresses related issues. <b>Rabba said: When I was in the house</b> of study <b>of Rav Huna, we raised the</b> following <b>dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to saying</b> the blessing for <b>time,</b> i.e., Who has given us life [<i>sheheḥeyanu</i>], <b>on Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur?</b> The two sides of the dilemma are as follows: Do we say that <b>since</b> these Festivals <b>come at fixed times</b> of the year, <b>we recite</b> the blessing: Who has given us life, just as we would for any other joyous event that occurs at fixed intervals? <b>Or</b> do we say, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>since</b> these Festivals <b>are not called pilgrim Festivals [<i>regalim</i>], we do not recite:</b> Who has given us life, as the joy that they bring is insufficient? Rav Huna <b>did not have</b> an answer <b>at hand.</b><br><b>When I came to the house</b> of study <b>of Rav Yehuda, he said: I recite</b> the blessing for <b>time</b> even <b>on a new gourd,</b> and I certainly recite the blessing on Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur. <b>I said to him: I have no dilemma</b> about the fact that one has the <b>option</b> of reciting the blessing for time; <b>the dilemma I have is</b> about whether there is an <b>obligation</b> to recite the blessing. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this regard? Rav Yehuda <b>said to me</b> that <b>it was Rav and Shmuel who both said: One recites</b> the blessing for <b>time only on the three pilgrim Festivals.</b><br>The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Give a portion to seven, and also to eight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:2). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “Seven,” these are the seven days of Creation; “eight,” these are the eight days</b> until <b>circumcision. Rabbi Yehoshua says: “Seven,” these are the seven days of Passover; “eight,” these are the eight days of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>And when it says: “And also,”</b> like every other instance of the word “also” in the Torah, this comes <b>to include;</b> what it includes is <b><i>Shavuot</i>, and Rosh HaShana, and Yom Kippur.</b><br><b>What, is</b> this exposition <b>not</b> coming <b>to</b> teach us that on these days one is obligated to recite the blessing for <b>time?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to the blessing</b> recited over the special sanctity of the day.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to explain, <b>as if it would enter your mind</b> to say that it is referring <b>to</b> the blessing for <b>time, is there</b> a blessing for <b>time</b> that is recited <b>all seven</b> days of the Festival? It is recited only on the first day. The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as it means <b>that if he does not recite the blessing</b> for time <b>now, he recites</b> the blessing <b>tomorrow or the following day,</b> as all seven days are part of the pilgrim Festival.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>In any case, we require</b> that this blessing be recited over <b>a cup</b> of wine, and most people do not have cups of wine for the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Let us say</b> that this <b>supports Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman said:</b> The blessing for <b>time may be recited even in the market,</b> without a cup of wine. The Gemara responds: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as the case is that <b>he happened to have a cup;</b> but without a cup of wine, the blessing may not be recited.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> one can recite the blessing over a cup of wine on <b><i>Shavuot</i> and Rosh HaShana;</b> but <b>what does one do on Yom Kippur? If</b> you say that <b>he should recite the blessing</b> over a cup of wine before the actual commencement of Yom Kippur <b>and drink it,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>Since he recited</b> the blessing for <b>time, he accepted</b> the sanctity of the day <b>upon himself, and</b> therefore <b>caused</b> the wine <b>to be prohibited to himself</b> by the laws of Yom Kippur.<br><b>As didn’t Rav Yirmeya bar Abba say</b> the following <b>to Rav,</b> upon observing him recite <i>kiddush</i> before the actual commencement of Shabbat: <b>Have you</b> therefore accepted the obligation to <b>abstain</b> from labor from this point on? <b>And he said to him: Yes, I have</b> accepted the obligation to <b>abstain</b> from labor. This indicates that once one recites <i>kiddush</i> and accepts upon himself the sanctity of the day, all the laws of the day apply to him. Accordingly, if one recited the blessing for time for Yom Kippur, he may no longer eat or drink.<br>And if you say that <b>he should recite the blessing over</b> a cup of wine <b>and leave it</b> and drink it only after the conclusion of Yom Kippur, this too is difficult, as the principle is that <b>one who recites a blessing</b> over a cup of wine <b>must taste</b> from it. If you say <b>that he should give it to a child,</b> who is not obligated to fast, this too is not feasible because <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa,</b> who made a similar suggestion with regard to a different matter, due to a concern that <b>perhaps</b> the child <b>will come to be drawn after</b> it. The child might come to drink wine on Yom Kippur even in future years after he comes of age, and we do not institute a practice that might turn into a stumbling block.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about this</b> matter? Must one recite the blessing: Who has given us life, on Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur? <b>The Sages sent Rav Yeimar the Elder before Rav Ḥisda on the eve of Rosh HaShana. They said to him: Go, see how he acts</b> in this regard and then <b>come</b> and <b>tell us. When</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>saw</b> Rav Yeimar, <b>he said to him</b> in the words of a folk saying: <b>One who picks up a moist log,</b> which is not fit for firewood, must want to do <b>something on the spot.</b> In other words, you certainly have come to me with some purpose in mind, and not just for a visit. <b>They brought him a cup of wine, and he recited <i>kiddush</i> and</b> the blessing for <b>time.</b><br>The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one recites</b> the blessing for <b>time on Rosh HaShana and on Yom Kippur,</b> and <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one may recite</b> the blessing for <b>time even in the market,</b> as it does not require a cup of wine.<br>Having discussed a question that was raised during Rabba’s student years, the Gemara now records another such question. <b>And Rabba</b> also <b>said: When we were in the house</b> of study <b>of Rav Huna, we raised the</b> following <b>dilemma: A student in his master’s house who is fasting on Shabbat eve, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether he has <b>to complete</b> the fast until the end of the day? Do we perhaps say that he must stop fasting before Shabbat, so as not to enter Shabbat weary from his fast? Rav Huna <b>did not have</b> an answer <b>at hand. I</b> subsequently <b>came before Rav Yehuda, and he</b> too <b>did not have</b> an answer <b>at hand.</b><br><b>Rava said: Let us look</b> ourselves for an answer from the sources. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the case of <b>the Ninth of Av that occurs on Shabbat,</b><br><br></body></html>
