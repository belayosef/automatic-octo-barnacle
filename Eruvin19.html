Daf 19a<br><br><b>for planting vines”</b> (Micah 1:6), which benefits all the surrounding inhabitants.<br><b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> For <b>the attribute of flesh and blood</b> is to <b>place an</b> iron or wooden <b>hook in the mouth</b> of <b>a person who was sentenced to death by the government, so that he should not</b> be able to <b>curse the king</b> when he is taken away for execution.<br>But <b>the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He</b> is that <b>one is</b> willingly <b>silent</b> when he <b>is sentenced to death by the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “For You silence is praise,</b> O God in Zion, and to You shall the vow be performed” (Psalms 65:2). <b>And what is more, he praises</b> God for his sufferings, <b>as it is stated: “Praise.” And what is more, it appears to him as though he were offering a sacrifice</b> in atonement for his sin, <b>as it is stated: “And to You shall the vow be performed.”</b><br><b>And this is</b> what <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Those who pass through the valley of weeping turn it into a water spring; moreover, the early rain covers it with blessings”</b> (Psalms 84:7)?<br><b>“Those who pass through [<i>overei</i>],” these are people who transgress [<i>overin</i>] the will of the Holy One, Blessed be He. “Valley [<i>emek</i>]”</b> indicates that their punishment is that <b>Gehenna is deepened [<i>ma’amikin</i>] for them. “Of weeping [<i>bakha</i>]”</b> and “turn it into a water spring [<i>ma’ayan yeshituhu</i>],” indicates that <b>they weep [<i>bokhin</i>] and make tears flow like a spring [<i>ma’ayan</i>] of the foundations [<i>shitin</i>],</b> meaning like a spring that descends to the foundations of the earth. <b>“Moreover, the early rain covers it with blessings,”</b> indicates that <b>they accept</b> the justice of God’s <b>judgment, and say before Him: Master of the Universe, You have judged properly, You have acquitted properly, You have condemned properly, and it is befitting that You have prepared Gehenna for the wicked and the Garden of Eden for the righteous.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say: The wicked do not repent, even at the entrance to Gehenna, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who rebel against Me;</b> for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” (Isaiah 66:24)? The verse <b>does not say: Who rebelled, but</b> rather: <b>“Who rebel,”</b> in the present tense, meaning <b>they continue rebelling forever.</b><br>The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> i.e., where it is said that they accept God’s judgment, it is referring <b>to the sinners of the Jewish people; there,</b> i.e., where it is said that they do not recant, it is referring <b>to the rebels among the nations of the world.</b><br><b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say this, for <b>if</b> you do not say <b>so,</b> there would be <b>a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Reish Lakish and</b> another statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish said:</b> With regard to <b>the sinners of the Jewish people, the fire of Gehenna has no power over them,</b> as may be learned by <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> reasoning <b>from the golden altar.</b><br><b>If the golden altar</b> in the Temple, <b>which was only covered by</b> gold <b>the thickness of a golden dinar, stood for many years and the fire did not burn it,</b> for its gold did not melt, so too <b>the sinners of the Jewish people, who are filled with good deeds like a pomegranate, as it is stated: “Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>] are like a split pomegranate</b> behind your veil” (Song of Songs 6:7), will not be affected by the fire of Gehenna. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> about this: <b>Do not read: Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>], but</b> rather: <b>Your empty ones [<i>reikateikh</i>],</b> meaning that <b>even the sinners among you are full of mitzvot like a pomegranate; how much more so</b> should the fire of Gehenna have no power over them.<br><b>However, that which is written: “Those who pass through the valley of weeping”</b> (Psalms 84:7), which implies that the sinners nonetheless descend to Gehenna, should be explained as follows: <b>There</b> it speaks of <b>those who are liable at that time</b> for punishment <b>in Gehenna, but our father Abraham comes and raises them up and receives them.</b> He does not leave the circumcised behind and allow them to enter Gehenna, <b>except for a Jew who had relations with a gentile woman,</b> in punishment for which <b>his foreskin is drawn, and</b> our father Abraham <b>does not recognize him</b> as one of his descendants.<br><b>Rav Kahana strongly objected to this: Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that the words <b>those who rebel</b> are referring to <b>those who go on rebelling, if so,</b> in those verses in which <b>it is written of</b> Him: <b>“He Who brings out”</b> (see Exodus 6:7) <b>and “He Who raises up”</b> Israel from Egypt (see Leviticus 11:45), do these expressions mean: <b>He Who is</b> currently <b>raising</b> them <b>up and bringing</b> them <b>out? Rather,</b> you must understand these terms to mean: <b>He Who</b> already <b>raised</b> them <b>up and brought</b> them <b>out; here too</b> then, the phrase those who rebel means <b>those who</b> already <b>rebelled.</b><br><b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: There are three entrances to Gehenna, one in the wilderness, one in the sea, and one in Jerusalem.</b> There is one entrance <b>in the wilderness, as it is written</b> with regard to Korah and his company: <b>“And they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit [<i>She’ol</i>],</b> and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the congregation” (Numbers 16:33).<br><b>In the sea</b> there is a second entrance to Gehenna, <b>as it is written</b> about Jonah in the fish’s belly: <b>“Out of the belly of the netherworld [<i>She’ol</i>] I cried, and You did hear my voice”</b> (Jonah 2:3).<br>And there is a third entrance to Gehenna <b>in Jerusalem, as it is written: “Says the Lord, Whose fire is in Zion, and Whose furnace is in Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:9). <b>And</b> it was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: “Whose fire is in Zion,” this is Gehenna; and “Whose furnace is in Jerusalem,” this is an entrance to Gehenna.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Are there no more</b> entrances? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Maryon say in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabba bar Maryon</b> who <b>taught in</b> the name of <b>the school of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: There are two date trees in the valley of ben Hinnom, and smoke rises from between them,</b> and with regard to <b>this</b> statement about date trees that differ from other palms <b>we learned: The palms of Har HaBarzel are fit</b> for the mitzva of palm branches [<i>lulav</i>], <b>and this is the entrance to Gehenna.</b> The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, for <b>perhaps this is the</b> entrance <b>in Jerusalem.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Gehenna has seven names, and they are as follows: She’ol, Avadon, Be’er Shaḥat, Bor Shaon, Tit HaYaven, Tzalmavet, and Eretz HaTaḥtit.</b><br><b>She’ol, as it is written: “Out of the belly of the netherworld [<i>she’ol</i>] I cried and You did hear my voice”</b> (Jonah 2:3). <b>Avadon, as it is written: “Shall Your steadfast love be reported in the grave or Your faithfulness in destruction [<i>avadon</i>]?”</b> (Psalms 88:12). <b>Be’er Shaḥat, as it is written: “For You will not abandon my soul to the netherworld; nor will You suffer Your pious one to see the pit [<i>shaḥat</i>]”</b> (Psalms 16:10). <b>And Bor Shaon and Tit HaYaven, as it is written: “He brought me up also out of the gruesome pit [<i>bor shaon</i>], out of the miry clay [<i>tit hayaven</i>]”</b> (Psalms 40:3). <b>And Tzalmavet, as it is written: “Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death [<i>tzalmavet</i>],</b> bound in affliction and iron” (Psalms 107:10). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Eretz Taḥtit,</b> i.e., the underworld, <b>it is</b> known by <b>tradition</b> that this is its name.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>Are there no more</b> names? <b>Isn’t there</b> the name <b>Gehenna?</b> The Gemara answers that this is not a name rather a description: <b>A valley that is as deep as the valley [<i>gei</i>] of</b> ben <b>Hinnom.</b> An alternative explanation is: <b>Into which all descend for vain [<i>hinnam</i>]</b> and wasteful <b>acts,</b> understanding the word <i>hinnam</i> as if it were written <i>ḥinnam</i>, meaning for naught.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t there</b> also the name <b>Tofte, as it is written: “For its hearth [<i>tofte</i>] is ordained of old”</b> (Isaiah 30:33). The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> name too is a description, meaning <b>that anyone who allows himself to be seduced [<i>mitpateh</i>] by his</b> evil <b>inclination will fall there.</b><br>Having discussed the entrances to Gehenna, the Gemara also mentions the entrance to <b>the Garden of Eden. Reish Lakish said: If it is in Eretz Yisrael, its entrance is Beit She’an, and if</b> it is <b>in Arabia, its entrance is Beit Garem, and if</b> it is <b>between the rivers</b> of Babylonia, <b>its entrance is Dumsekanin,</b> for all these places feature a great abundance of vegetation and fertile land. The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye</b> would <b>praise the fruits of the right bank</b> of the Euphrates River, <b>and Rava</b> would <b>praise the fruits of Harpanya.</b><br>The Gemara goes back to the mishna in which we learned: <b>And between them,</b> i.e., between the upright boards and the double posts, there may be a gap <b>the size of two teams</b> of four oxen each, as measured when tied together and not when they are untied. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious; since the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> that <b>they are tied, we know that they are not untied.</b><br>The Gemara answers: This is specified, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>tied</b> means <b>similar to tied,</b> i.e., close to each other, <b>but not</b> necessarily that they are <b>actually</b> tied. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that it is not enough that they be close; rather, they must be actually tied <b>and not untied.</b><br>The mishna continued: There must be sufficient space left so that <b>one can enter and another can leave.</b> A <i>Tosefta</i> <b>was taught</b> that explains the mishna: Enough space so that <b>one team can enter and</b> another <b>team can leave. Our Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much is</b> the length of <b>the head and most of the body of a cow? Two cubits. And how much is the thickness of a cow? A cubit and two-thirds of a cubit,</b><br><br>Daf 19b<br><br><b>so that</b> the total width of six oxen <b>is approximately ten</b> cubits; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda said</b> the following, in accordance with his own opinion that the gap may be the size of two teams of four oxen each: The total width is <b>approximately thirteen cubits or approximately fourteen cubits.</b><br>The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> say: <b>Approximately ten</b> cubits in Rabbi Meir’s statement? <b>Isn’t it</b> exactly <b>ten</b> cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>Since he wanted to teach: Approximately thirteen, in the last clause,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, he therefore also taught: Approximately ten, in the first clause.<br>The Gemara asks: But how could he say: <b>Approximately thirteen,</b> when <b>it is more?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since he wanted to teach: Approximately fourteen,</b> he therefore also teaches: Approximately thirteen. The Gemara continues this line of questioning: <b>But they are not approximately fourteen,</b> but rather are less. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is a third of a cubit <b>more than thirteen</b> cubits, <b>and</b> it does <b>not reach fourteen</b> cubits.<br><b>Rav Pappa said: With regard to</b> a water <b>cistern</b> whose own width is <b>eight</b> cubits, <b>everyone agrees,</b> both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir, <b>that there is no need</b> to position <b>upright</b> boards between the double posts. In such a case, the width of the enclosed area, which is the width of the cistern together with the space required for the cows, i.e., two cubits on each side, is twelve cubits. Since the width of each double post is one cubit, the gap between the double posts is ten cubits, and a gap of this size is permitted even according to Rabbi Meir.<br><b>With regard to a cistern</b> whose width is <b>twelve</b> cubits, <b>everyone agrees that there is a need for upright</b> posts. In this case, even if only two cubits are added on each side for the cows, the enclosed area will be sixteen cubits, and the gap between the double posts will be fourteen cubits, which must be closed off even according to Rabbi Yehuda.<br><b>Where they disagree</b> is in the case of a cistern whose width is <b>between eight</b> and <b>twelve</b> cubits. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, one must</b> add <b>upright</b> posts, whereas <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, one need not</b> add <b>upright</b> posts.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And what is Rav Pappa teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Meir the gap may not be more than ten cubits, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda it may be up to thirteen and a third cubits.<br>The Gemara answers: Indeed, for us nothing new is being taught here; however, <b>Rav Pappa did not hear</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>, and he taught us</b> on his own <b>as</b> was taught in the <b><i>baraita</i>.</b><br><b>Extended, more, in a mound, a barrier of, a courtyard, that dried up;</b> this is a <b>mnemonic</b> containing key words in a series of issues raised by Abaye before Rabba. <b>Abaye raised a dilemma before Rabba:</b> If the gaps between the double posts were more than ten cubits, and <b>one extended the double posts,</b> that is, he widened each arm of the corner pieces, adding <b>the measure of an upright</b> board, i.e., another cubit, on each side, so that the gaps were no longer more than ten cubits, <b>what</b> is the law <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> Do we say that this suffices and it is no longer necessary to arrange upright boards between the two double posts, or must upright boards be positioned in the gaps?<br>Rabba said <b>to him: We</b> already <b>learned it</b> in the mishna: <b>Provided that he increases the boards. Does</b> this <b>not</b> mean <b>that he extends the double posts,</b> increasing them in width? Abaye refutes this: <b>No,</b> perhaps it means <b>that he makes more upright</b> boards, increasing them in number.<br>Rabba said to him: <b>If so, this</b> wording: <b>Provided that he increases the boards,</b> is imprecise, for it implies that one increases the boards themselves, and instead <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>Provided that he increases the</b> number of upright <b>boards.</b> Abaye answered: There is no need to be particular about this. <b>Teach: Provided that he increases</b> the number of upright <b>boards.</b><br>The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion: <b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye as follows: <b>We</b> already <b>learned it: Provided that he increases the boards. Does</b> this <b>not</b> mean <b>that he makes more upright</b> boards, increasing them in number? Abaye refutes this: <b>No,</b> perhaps it means <b>that he extends the double posts,</b> increasing them in width.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say this, <b>from the fact that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Provided that he increases the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> which implies that he extends the width of the boards themselves, in accordance with the second version. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is the correct understanding.<br><b>Abaye raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabba:</b> If the gaps are <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits, what</b> is the law <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Does he bring upright</b> boards and position them between the double posts, <b>or does he extend the double posts,</b> increasing them in width?<br>Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> the law in a similar case, for it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How close</b> may the double posts be to the well? They can be <b>as</b> close as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow. And how far</b> may they be from the well? If one wishes, the enclosed area may be expanded <b>even</b> to the area of <b>a <i>kor</i> and even</b> to <b>two <i>kor</i>,</b> provided that one increases the number of upright boards adequately to keep the gaps under the allowable limit.<br>The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Up to an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to enclose the area in this manner; but expanding the enclosed area so it is <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> is prohibited.</b> The other Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do you not agree with regard to a pen, and stable, and a backyard, and a courtyard that even</b> an area <b>of five <i>beit kor</i> and even of ten <i>beit kor</i> is permitted</b> for use?<br>The <i>baraita</i> continues: Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> There is a significant difference between these cases, for <b>this</b> one, i.e., the wall surrounding the courtyard and the like, <b>is a</b> proper <b>partition, whereas these are</b> merely upright <b>boards.</b><br>The Gemara asks with regard to Rabba’s statement: <b>And if it is so</b> that one extend the double posts, this means that he makes a proper partition of increasingly wider double posts in the area surrounding the well, this is equivalent to the partitions of a courtyard, <b>he,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>should have</b> said: <b>This is a partition and that is a partition.</b><br>The Gemara answers: No proof can be brought from here, for Rabbi Yehuda <b>is saying as follows: This</b> one, the walls of a courtyard, are governed by <b>the laws of a partition, and</b> therefore <b>its breaches</b> must not be more than <b>ten</b> cubits. <b>Whereas these,</b> which surround the well, are governed by <b>the laws of</b> upright <b>boards, and their breaches</b> may be up to <b>thirteen and a third cubits.</b> Consequently, only an area of two <i>beit se’a</i> can be enclosed in this manner. Therefore, no proof can be brought from this <i>baraita</i> to Abaye’s dilemma.<br><b>Abaye raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabba: Can a mound that rises</b> to a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>within</b> an area of <b>four</b> cubits <b>serve as a double post or can it not serve as a double post?</b><br>Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned this</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If <b>a square stone was present, we see</b> the stone as if it were altered: <b>Wherever it can be divided</b> in such a way that <b>there would remain a cubit here</b> in one direction <b>and a cubit there</b> at a right angle to it, <b>it can serve as a double post; but if not, it cannot serve as a double post.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> If <b>a round stone was present, we see</b> the stone as if it were altered: <b>Wherever it could be chiseled</b> down into a square, <b>and then divided</b> in such a way that <b>there would remain a cubit here</b> in one direction <b>and a cubit there</b> at a right angle to it, <b>it can serve as a double post; but if not, it cannot serve as a double post.</b> In any case, it is learned from these two statements that anything can serve as a double post if it is of the requisite size and shape.<br>With regard to the <i>baraita</i> itself, the Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> these two <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>we say: We see, once.</b> However, <b>we do not say: We see, twice.</b> That is to say, while the stone can be considered as if it were divided, it cannot also be considered as though it were chiseled down into a square. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>holds</b> that <b>we even say: We see, twice.</b> Since a mound is similar to a round stone, it can therefore serve as a double post.<br><b>Abaye raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabba:</b> With regard to <b>a barrier of reeds</b> in the shape of a double post, where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths apart from the next, so that they are considered connected by the principle of <i>lavud</i>, <b>can it serve as a double post or not?</b><br>Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned this</b> law in a <i>baraita</i> that states: If <b>a tree, or a fence, or a barrier of reeds was present, it serves as a double post. Does</b> this <b>not</b> refer to a barrier of reeds where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths from the next?<br>The Gemara refutes this: <b>No,</b> it may perhaps refer to <b>a thicket of reeds</b> planted close together, forming a kind of post. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, it is</b> equivalent to <b>a tree,</b> and the <i>tanna</i> would not repeat the same case twice.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What, then?</b> Would you say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a barrier of reeds where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths apart? If so, <b>it is a fence. Rather, what must you say</b> is that the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches two types of fence; here too,</b> then, you can say that it teaches <b>two types of tree,</b> and therefore no proof can be brought from this <i>baraita</i>.<br>The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion: <b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that the question was posed differently, and the <b>dilemma</b> Abaye <b>raised before</b> Rabba was about whether or not a dense <b>thicket of reeds</b> can serve as a double post. Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned this</b> law in the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a tree, or a fence, or a barrier of reeds was present, it can serve as a double post. Does</b> this <b>not</b> refer to <b>a thicket of reeds?</b><br>The Gemara refutes this: <b>No,</b> it may perhaps refer to a barrier of reeds where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths apart from the next. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, it is</b> exactly <b>a fence.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What, then?</b> Would you say that the <i>baraita</i> refers to <b>a thicket of reeds?</b> If so, <b>this is a tree.
