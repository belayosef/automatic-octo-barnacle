Daf 52a<br><br>He <b>would declare</b> on Shabbat eve: <b>My residence is in Tzinta,</b> a settlement located between the Shabbat limits of the two places. <b>Abaye said to him: What is your opinion</b> that led you to act in that manner? Is it because in a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between these two Sages is in a case where the person said: My residence is <b>in such-and-such place,</b> and you rely on Rabbi Yehuda and establish residence at a place between the two cities even though you are still at home?<br><b>But didn’t Rav Naḥman</b> explain the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda differently, <b>and</b> furthermore, a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with his</b> opinion. Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: I retract</b> my opinion and will no longer do so.<br><b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> The Sages <b>have said</b> that one who <b>establishes</b> residence by foot <b>has four cubits</b> at that location, and another two thousand cubits beyond. However, with regard to <b>one who deposits his <i>eiruv</i></b> in a certain place, there is a dilemma whether he <b>has four cubits</b> from the site of his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>or not.</b><br><b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the mishna: The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with bread only to be lenient with the wealthy</b> person, <b>so that he</b> need <b>not</b> exert himself and <b>go out and establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet. And if you say</b> that one who establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with bread <b>does not have</b> four cubits, is <b>this</b> really <b>a leniency? It is a stringency.</b> Based on the mishna, apparently, all leniencies that apply to one who establishes an <i>eiruv</i> by foot must also apply to one who establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with bread.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: No proof can be cited from there, as <b>even</b> if he without the four cubits, <b>this is preferable to him, so that he</b> need <b>not exert himself and go out</b> and establish an <i>eiruv</i> by foot. Therefore, it can be said that establishing an <i>eiruv</i> with bread constitutes a leniency even if it entails the loss of four cubits.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a person set out to go</b> on a Shabbat eve <b>to a town for which an <i>eiruv</i> is established</b> in order to go there on Shabbat, <b>and another</b> person <b>caused him to return</b> home, <b>he</b> himself <b>is permitted to go</b> to that city on Shabbat, <b>and</b> for <b>all the</b> other <b>residents of the town it is prohibited</b> to go there. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br><b>Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who can establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> and negated his residence in his original place, <b>and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., he did not at least state that he seeks to establish residence somewhere else, <b>is</b> likened to both <b>a donkey driver,</b> who walks behind the animal and prods it, <b>and a camel driver,</b> who walks before the animal and leads it, in the sense that he is pulled in two opposite directions. Due to the uncertainty with regard to the location of his Shabbat limit, his movement is restricted as though his residence was established in both his city and at a location along the way to the other city. He may not venture beyond two thousand cubits from either location.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that according to Rabbi Yehuda, he himself is permitted to go to the other city, while for all the rest of the residents of his city it is prohibited to do so, the Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>him and what is different</b> about <b>them?</b> Why is he permitted to proceed to the other city, while they are not? <b>Rav Huna said: We are dealing here with</b> a case <b>where</b> that person <b>has two houses,</b> one in each town, <b>with</b> the distance of <b>two Shabbat limits,</b> four thousand cubits, <b>between them.</b><br>With regard to <b>him, since he set out on his way, his</b> legal status <b>is</b> that of <b>a pauper,</b> as he did not intend to return to his first house but to continue to his other house, and he can therefore establish residence at the end of his Shabbat limit simply by declaring that he wishes to acquire residence in such-and-such place. <b>And</b> the legal status of <b>these</b> other inhabitants of his city, <b>is</b> that of <b>wealthy people,</b> as they are in their houses and have food. Consequently, they can only establish residence at the end of their Shabbat limit by depositing food there prior the onset of Shabbat.<br><b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who has two houses, with</b> the distance of <b>two Shabbat limits between them, once he set out on the way,</b> clearly demonstrating his intention to leave, although he did not explicitly say: My residence is at the end of my Shabbat limit, <b>he acquired an <i>eiruv</i></b> there. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br><b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda said: Even if another found him</b> before he left, <b>and said to him: Spend the night here, it is a hot period,</b> or it <b>is a cold period</b> and inadvisable to set out now, <b>on the following day he may rise early and go</b> to the other town, as his intention to walk is sufficient.<br><b>Rabba said:</b> With regard <b>to saying</b> that he is establishing residence at the end of his Shabbat limit, <b>everyone agrees</b> that this <b>is necessary,</b> as otherwise it could be understood that he is returning to his house because he changed his mind about establishing residence elsewhere. <b>When they disagree</b> is with regard to whether or not it is necessary for him actually to <b>set out</b> on his way. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that he must have set out on his way, whereas Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, maintains that he need not even set out on his way, as his intention to leave is sufficient.<br><b>And Rav Yosef said:</b> With regard <b>to</b> actually <b>setting out</b> on his way, <b>everyone agrees</b> that this <b>is necessary. Where they disagree</b> is with regard to whether or not it is necessary for him <b>to say</b> that he is establishing his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>halakha</i> that <b>Ulla stated?</b> If <b>a person set out on his way, and another persuaded him to return</b> home, <b>he is</b> considered <b>returned and</b> is considered <b>set out</b> on his way.<br>The Gemara analyzes Ulla’s statement itself: <b>If he is</b> considered <b>returned,</b> with the same legal status as the rest of the residents of his city and has not established residence elsewhere, <b>why</b> is he described as <b>set out</b> on his way? <b>And if</b> he is considered <b>set out</b> on his way, indicating that he established residence at the end of his Shabbat limit, <b>why is</b> he described as <b>returned?</b><br>The Gemara answers: Emend Ulla’s statement and explain that <b>this is</b> what <b>he is saying: Although he was returned</b> to his original place, he is nonetheless regarded as having <b>set out</b> on his way. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did he state this ruling? <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef,</b> that everyone agrees he must set out on his way, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that he need not declare he is establishing his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda bar Ishtata</b> once <b>brought a basket of fruit to Rav Natan bar Oshaya</b> in a nearby town, four thousand cubits away, on Shabbat eve. <b>When he was going,</b> Rav Natan <b>left him until he descended one step, and</b> then <b>said to him: Lodge here</b> tonight. He allowed him start his journey so that he would be considered as having set out on his way. <b>On the following day</b> Rav Yehuda bar Ishtata <b>rose early and went</b> home.<br><br>Daf 52b<br><br>The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Natan bar Oshaya act? Apparently, it was <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef</b> that everyone agrees that he must set out on his way, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda</b> that he need not declare that he is establishing his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit.<br>The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> that is not necessarily so, as it is possible to say that he acted <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and Rav Yehuda bar Ishtata declared that he establishes his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who can establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> and negated his residence in his original place, and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, is likened to both a donkey driver and a camel driver. The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t we have</b> already <b>learned</b> it <b>once</b> before in another mishna: In a case of <b>uncertainty, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda say: This</b> person <b>is</b> likened to both <b>a donkey driver</b> and <b>a camel driver.</b> Here too, it is obvious that the same applies, as that is Rabbi Meir’s opinion with regard to all uncertain cases.<br><b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> It is necessary to state this ruling here as well, so that <b>you will not say the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi Meir’s</b> statement only applies in a case where there is <b>uncertainty whether</b> one <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> or <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> and in <b>that</b> case <b>he is</b> in likened to both <b>a donkey driver</b> and <b>a camel driver. However,</b> in a case where there is <b>certainty</b> that he <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> he is not</b> likened to both <b>a donkey driver</b> and <b>a camel driver,</b> but his Shabbat limit is the same as the rest of the residents of his city.<br><b>Rather,</b> say that <b>even</b> in a case where there is <b>certainty</b> that he <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> he is sometimes likened to both <b>a donkey driver</b> and <b>a camel driver, as here he certainly did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, and</b> yet <b>he is</b> likened to both <b>a donkey driver</b> and <b>a camel driver.</b> It was therefore necessary to state that even in that case, where there is no uncertainty whether or not he established the <i>eiruv</i>, but only with regard to the location of his residence, he nonetheless has the status of both a donkey driver and a camel driver.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who</b> intentionally, not for the purpose of performing a mitzva, <b>went out beyond</b> his Shabbat <b>limit, even</b> if only <b>one</b> cubit, <b>may not reenter. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If he went out <b>two</b> cubits <b>he may reenter;</b> however, if he went out <b>three</b> cubits <b>he may not reenter.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> If <b>one of his feet was within the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, and his other foot was beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, he may not reenter, as it is written: “If you turn away your feet [<i>raglekha</i>] due to Shabbat”</b> (Isaiah 58:13). The word <i>raglekha</i> <b>is written</b> in defective form without the letter <i>yod</i>, and can therefore be read as <b>your foot</b> in the singular, indicating that Shabbat can be desecrated by the reentry of even a single foot.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But wasn’t</b> the opposite <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>? If <b>one of his feet was within the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, and his other foot was beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, he may reenter.</b> The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> taught? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: He is attributed to the place where the majority of his body</b> lies, and therefore, it is permitted for him to enter, as he stepped out with only one foot.<br>The Gemara cites a different version of the previous discussion. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> If <b>one of his feet was within the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, and his other foot was beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, he may reenter, as it is written: “If you turn away your feet due to Shabbat”</b> (Isaiah 58:13). <b>We read</b> the word <i>raglekha</i> as <b>your feet,</b> in the plural, indicating that the entry of a single foot is permitted.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But wasn’t</b> the opposite <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He may not reenter?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥanina <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He is attributed to the place where the majority of his body</b> is located, and it is therefore permitted to enter, as most of his body remains within the Shabbat limit.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If he went out <b>two</b> cubits <b>he may reenter;</b> however, if he went out <b>three</b> cubits <b>he may not reenter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If he went out <b>one</b> cubit <b>he may reenter;</b> however, if he went out <b>two</b> cubits <b>he may not reenter.</b> The Gemara answers: That is <b>not a difficulty. This,</b> the mishna, is referring to a case where <b>he moved</b> from <b>the first</b> cubit <b>and is</b> now <b>standing two</b> cubits out, and therefore it is permitted for him to reenter; <b>however, that,</b> the <i>baraita</i>, is referring to a case where <b>he moved</b> from <b>the second</b> cubit <b>and is</b> now <b>standing three</b> cubits out. Consequently, it is prohibited for him to reenter.<br>The Gemara raises another difficulty. <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> if he went <b>one cubit</b> out, <b>he may not enter.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught</b> it was with regard to <b>one measuring</b> his limit by counting two thousand steps. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>And</b> for <b>one</b> established residence in a particular place, and <b>is</b> now <b>measuring</b> his limit by counting out steps, <b>with regard to whom</b> the Sages <b>said one provides him</b> with <b>two thousand cubits, even if his measurement ended in a cave</b> he may not walk even one cubit beyond his measurement.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one</b> for <b>whom it grew dark</b> while he was traveling <b>outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit</b> of the town where he was heading, <b>even</b> if he was only <b>one cubit</b> outside the limit <b>he may not enter</b> the town. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if he was <b>fifteen cubits</b> beyond the limit <b>he may enter</b> the town, <b>because the surveyors do not precisely demarcate the measures;</b> rather, they mark the Shabbat limit within the two thousand cubits, <b>due to those who err.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement: Due to those who err, it is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Due to those who err in their measurement.</b> In other words, because the surveyors are concerned that they might have erred in their measurements, they are stringent and do not position the mark at the edge of the limit, but move it several cubits within the limit.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How does one extend</b> the boundaries of <b>cities</b> in order to ensure that all its protrusions are included within the borders of the city? He extends a straight line across the edge of the city, and if <b>a house is recessed and</b> another <b>house protrudes,</b> or <b>a turret [<i>pagum</i>] is recessed and</b> another <b>turret protrudes</b> from that line, and similarly, if <b>there were remnants</b> of walls <b>ten handbreadths high,</b><br><br></body></html>
