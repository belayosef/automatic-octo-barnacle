Daf 88a<br><br><b>the inhabitants of Tiberias</b> are considered <b>like one</b> who does so in order <b>not to neglect his</b> usual <b>work.</b> Most of them are ordinary laborers. It can be assumed that if they rose early to bring home straw or stalks in which to store their produce, they did so only to save work time.<br>The Gemara turns to the third activity that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya permitted for the inhabitants of Tiberias: <b>And they may dry themselves with a towel. What is</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> who washed himself in cold water on Shabbat or a Festival <b>may dry himself with a towel and place it on a window,</b> as there is no concern that he perform the prohibited labor of wringing out the towel. <b>And he may not give</b> the towel <b>to the bathhouse attendants [<i>olayerin</i>] because they are suspected with regard to that matter,</b> as they might wring out the towel before giving it to other bathers. Furthermore, one may not bring the towel home because if he does so, he might forget and wring it out. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: He may even bring</b> the towel <b>in his hand to his house,</b> as there is no concern lest he wring it.<br><b>Rabba bar Rav Huna: They taught</b> the leniency of partitions surrounding a hole in a balcony <b>only</b> with regard <b>to drawing</b> water through the hole; <b>but to pour</b> waste water down the hole, it is <b>prohibited.</b><br><b>Rav Sheizvi raised an objection against this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>And what is</b> the difference <b>between this</b> case of a hole in the balcony <b>and</b> that of <b>a pit [<i>uka</i>]</b> used in a courtyard for waste water? The Sages rule in the next mishna below that one who digs a pit with a capacity of two <i>se’a</i> in a small courtyard that is less than four cubits may pour waste water into the courtyard on Shabbat, even if the pit was full before Shabbat. He need not be concerned that this will cause water to flow out of the courtyard into the public domain on Shabbat.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> waters, which are poured out into the courtyard, <b>are</b> likely to be <b>absorbed</b> into the ground, and it is therefore uncertain that the water will indeed leave the courtyard. <b>But these,</b> the water poured through the hole into the body of water under the balcony, <b>will not be absorbed.</b> Therefore, one knows with certainty that the water will flow out beyond the permitted boundary.<br><b>Some say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> actually <b>said: You should not say that it is</b> only <b>drawing</b> water through the hole in the balcony <b>that is permitted,</b> while <b>pouring</b> waste water through it <b>is prohibited; rather, pouring</b> waste water through the hole <b>is also permitted. Rav Sheizvi said:</b> This is <b>obvious,</b> as <b>this is</b> exactly the same as the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>pit</b> discussed in the next mishna. The Gemara rejects this argument: It is necessary to specify both <i>halakhot</i>, <b>lest you say</b> there is a difference between the cases, as <b>these,</b> the water poured in the courtyard, <b>are</b> likely to be <b>absorbed</b> into the ground, <b>whereas these,</b> the water poured through the hole in the balcony, <b>will not be absorbed.</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that we do not distinguish between the two cases.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>And likewise,</b> if there are <b>two balconies, one</b> above the other, and a partition is erected for the upper balcony but is not erected for the lower one, it is prohibited for residents of both balconies to draw water through the upper one, unless they establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> between them. <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: They taught</b> that one balcony renders it prohibited for residents of the other <b>only where</b> the one balcony <b>is near</b> the other, i.e., horizontally within four handbreadths. <b>But</b> if each balcony is <b>separated</b> by four handbreadths from the other, so that the residents of each balcony can use the other only by means of the air, the residents of <b>the upper</b> balcony <b>are permitted</b> to draw water, while the residents of the lower one are prohibited from doing so.<br><b>And Rav</b> follows <b>his</b> regular line of <b>argument</b> here, <b>as Rav said: One person does not impose restrictions upon another person by way of the air.</b> Since the lower balcony is far from the higher one, it does not prohibit it, although it can make use of it by means of the vacant airspace between them, albeit with difficulty.<br><b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said, and Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>stealing applies to Shabbat</b> domains, <b>and a ruin must be returned to its owner.</b><br>The Gemara registers surprise: <b>This</b> ruling <b>itself is difficult,</b> i.e., it is self-contradictory. <b>You</b> first <b>said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>stealing applies to Shabbat</b> domains, which at this point is understood by the Gemara as referring to the following case: A person’s house adjoins the ruin of another, and he observes that the ruin has been left deserted by its owner. If this person uses the ruin during the week, on Shabbat he may treat it as though it were his own, by carrying objects from his own house into the ruin and vice versa. <b>From here</b> we can infer that a stolen place <b>is acquired</b> for the purpose of Shabbat domains, although it does not belong to the person for other purposes. However, you subsequently said that <b>a ruin must be returned to its owner,</b> and <b>from here</b> we can infer that a ruin <b>is not acquired</b> for the purpose of Shabbat domains by the person who used it during the week, and therefore he may not carry objects from his own house into the ruin.<br>The Gemara answers: We should not understand this statement as suggested above, but rather <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Oshaya <b>are saying: The <i>halakha</i> of</b> returning <b>stolen</b> property <b>applies to Shabbat</b> domains. <b>How so?</b> This means <b>that a ruin must be returned to its owner.</b> In other words, one who uses a ruin during the week does not acquire it even for the purpose of Shabbat domains.<br><b>Rabba said: And we</b> ourselves <b>raised an objection</b> against <b>our</b> own <b>teaching,</b> as we learned in the mishna. <b>And likewise,</b> if there are <b>two balconies, one above the other,</b> they prohibit one another. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> against <b>stealing applies on Shabbat,</b> which means one may not use the domain of another, and he acquires no rights to it if he does so, <b>why</b> are the two balconies <b>prohibited</b> from using it. The lower one has no right to make use of the upper one.<br><b>Rav Sheshet said: We are dealing here with</b> a situation <b>where, for example,</b> the residents of the upper balcony and the residents of the lower balcony <b>jointly erected a partition</b> for the upper balcony. Consequently, the residents of the lower balcony share the right to use it with the residents of the upper one.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> in a case <b>where they erected</b> a separate partition <b>for the lower</b> balcony, the residents of the upper balcony should <b>likewise</b> be prohibited to use it. As the residents of the lower one are partners in the upper one, they should prohibit its residents from using it.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Since they erected</b> a separate partition <b>for the lower</b> balcony, <b>they</b> each thereby <b>revealed their intention</b> to the residents of the upper balcony <b>that: It is not my wish to be</b> partners <b>with you.</b> Consequently, they no longer prohibit the residents of the upper balcony from using it.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a courtyard that is less than four cubits</b> by four cubits in area, <b>one may not pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat, unless a pit was fashioned</b> to receive the water, and the pit <b>holds two <i>se’a</i></b> in volume <b>from its edge below.</b><br>This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>whether</b> the pit was fashioned <b>outside</b> the courtyard <b>or</b> whether it was dug <b>inside</b> the courtyard itself. The <b>only</b> difference is as follows: <b>If</b> the pit was dug <b>outside</b> in the adjoining public domain, <b>it is necessary to arch over</b> it, so that the water will not flow into the public domain. If it was dug <b>inside</b> the courtyard, <b>it is not necessary to arch over</b> it.<br><b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the case of a drainage <b>ditch whose</b> first <b>four cubits are arched over in the public domain, one may pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat. And the Rabbis say: Even</b> if <b>a roof or a courtyard</b> is <b>a hundred cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour</b> water directly <b>onto the mouth of the</b> drainage <b>ditch. However, he may pour</b> it <b>upon the roof,</b> from which <b>the water spills into the drain</b> of its own accord.<br><b>A courtyard and a portico,</b> a roofed but unwalled structure in front of a house, <b>combine for the four cubits</b> by virtue of which it is permitted to pour water even into a courtyard that lacks a pit. <b>And likewise,</b> with regard to <b>two upper stories [<i>deyotaot</i>], one opposite the other</b> in the same small courtyard, if the residents of <b>one</b> of them <b>fashioned a pit</b> in the courtyard, <b>and</b> the residents of <b>the other did not fashion a pit, those who fashioned a pit are permitted</b> to pour their waste water into the courtyard, whereas <b>those who did not fashion a pit are prohibited</b> to do so.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that a courtyard four by four cubits in area does not require a pit? <b>Rabba said: Because a person ordinarily uses two <i>se’a</i> of water a day,</b> and with regard to a courtyard <b>of</b> at least <b>four cubits</b> by four cubits, <b>a person wants to sprinkle</b> the water on the ground to prevent any dust from rising. Consequently, even if in practice the water does flow out of the courtyard, this effect is not necessarily his intention.<br><br>Daf 88b<br><br>But if the courtyard is <b>less than four cubits</b> by four cubits in area, <b>one</b> simply <b>pours</b> the water out, as the place is not fit for sprinkling. Therefore, <b>if one fashioned a pit, it is permitted</b> to pour out water; but if <b>not, it is prohibited</b> to do so, as one certainly intends for the water to flow outside.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira</b> offered a different reason and <b>said:</b> In a courtyard of <b>four cubits</b> by four cubits, the water is likely to be <b>absorbed</b> into the ground. If it is <b>less than four cubits</b> in size, the water <b>will not be absorbed</b> but will flow out.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical <b>difference between</b> these two explanations? <b>Abaye said: There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a <b>long and narrow</b> courtyard. As the area of this courtyard is also sixteen square cubits, it likewise absorbs the water. Rabbi Zeira would therefore rule that it does not require a pit. However, as this courtyard is not in need of sprinkling, it requires a pit according to Rabba.<br><b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>A courtyard and a portico combine for the</b> requisite <b>four cubits,</b> permitted the pouring of water into a courtyard that lacks a pit. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> this <b>works out well,</b> as the total area is large enough to absorb the water. <b>However, according to Rabba it is difficult,</b> for when the courtyard is joined with the portico it is no longer in the shape of a square, and it is therefore unfit for sprinkling.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira explained</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> by saying that it is referring <b>to a portico that extends along the entire courtyard,</b> so that it adds to its width alone. Consequently, the courtyard and the portico together form a square of four by four cubits, an area that is fit for sprinkling.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> that can decide this dispute. With regard to <b>a courtyard that is not four cubits by four cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour water into it on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara assumes that the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one may pour water only into a courtyard that it is four by four cubits, is precise in its wording. <b>Granted, according to Rabba,</b> this <b>works out well,</b> as he maintains that it is prohibited to pour water into a long and narrow courtyard. <b>However, according to Rabbi Zeira,</b> who maintains that the critical factor is the area of the courtyard, this is <b>difficult.</b><br>The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> can <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> at the end of the mishna, who maintain that the area of the courtyard is of no importance, <b>whereas our</b> unattributed <b>mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> according to whom the area is the decisive factor.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And what forced Rabbi Zeira to establish the mishna in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? Rava said: The mishna was difficult for him. Why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> his ruling with respect to <b>a courtyard that is less</b> than four cubits, from which it can be inferred that if it has an area of four by four cubits it is permitted to pour water, even if it is not square in shape? <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>teach: A courtyard that is not four cubits by four cubits,</b> i.e., one that is not square shaped, even if it includes an area of sixteen square cubits.<br><b>Rather, shouldn’t one conclude from this</b> argument that the unattributed section of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov?</b> The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that it is so.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty with this conclusion: <b>But from</b> the fact that <b>a latter clause</b> of the mishna explicitly cites the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> does <b>not</b> represent the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this argument: In fact, <b>the entire</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, and</b> as for its problematic style, the mishna <b>is incomplete and it teaches the following:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard that is less than four cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat. Consequently,</b> if it is <b>four cubits</b> in area, <b>one may pour</b> water into it, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If the first <b>four cubits of a</b> drainage <b>ditch were arched over in the public domain, one may pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat.</b><br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If the first four cubits of a drainage <b>ditch were arched over</b> in the public domain, it is permitted to pour waste water into it on Shabbat. However, the Rabbis say: One may pour water only upon the roof, from which it will spill into the drain of its own accord.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> was <b>not</b> taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya. For it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says: Even</b> with regard to <b>a roof one hundred cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour</b> water onto it, <b>because a roof is not apt to absorb</b> the water. <b>Rather, it</b> causes it <b>to run off.</b> Consequently, pouring water onto this roof is equivalent to pouring it directly outside.<br>A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that a pit is required, <b>said? In the summer, but in the rainy season, one may pour and repeat, and</b> he need <b>not hold back. What is the reason? Rava said: A person is</b> equally <b>willing for the water to be absorbed on the spot,</b> i.e., as there is abundant water in the courtyard during the rainy season, it will remain muddy in any case, and he therefore does not care whether the added waste water remains in the courtyard or if it flows out.<br><b>Abaye said to him:</b> With regard to <b>waste</b> water poured into a drainage ditch, <b>that a person wants it to be absorbed</b> in the ditch itself, rather than flow out, <b>and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>one may not pour</b> water into the ditch.<br>Rava <b>said to him: There,</b> during the rainy season, there is no reason to prohibit the practice, for <b>with regard to what need we be concerned? If</b> you say he wants the water to flow out into the public domain <b>because</b> he is concerned about <b>spoiling</b> and sullying <b>his courtyard,</b> it is <b>already spoiled</b> by the rainwater. <b>And if</b> you say it should be prohibited <b>due to a decree lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>so-and-so’s gutter is flowing with water</b> on Shabbat, which might lead them to think he is watering his garden or violating some other prohibition, and they might act likewise even in the summer, this is not a relevant concern. As <b>gutters ordinarily flow</b> with water in the rainy season, people do not entertain this suspicion.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said: In the rainy season,</b> with regard to <b>a pit that holds two <i>se’a</i>, we grant him</b> permission to pour <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> of water into it. If it <b>holds</b> only <b>one <i>se’a</i>, we grant him one <i>se’a</i>.</b> However, <b>in the summer,</b> if the pit has a capacity of <b>two <i>se’a</i>, we grant him two <i>se’a</i>;</b> if it holds only <b>one <i>se’a</i>, we do not grant him</b> permission to pour any water <b>at all.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>In the hot season as well,</b> if the pit <b>holds one <i>se’a</i>, let us grant him one <i>se’a</i>,</b> for if he pours only this amount of water, it will not flow out into the public domain. The Gemara answers: This is prohibited due to <b>a decree lest he come to put two <i>se’a</i> into it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, in the rainy season let us also apply the</b> same <b>preventive measure.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the rainy season, there is no reason to prohibit the practice, for if one pours more water into a pit than it can take, <b>about what need we be concerned? If</b> you say he wants the waste water to flow out into the public domain <b>because</b> he is concerned about <b>spoiling</b> his courtyard, <b>it is already spoiled</b> by the rainwater. <b>If</b> you say it should be prohibited due to <b>a decree lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>so-and-so’s gutter is flowing with water</b> on Shabbat, <b>gutters ordinarily gush</b> with water in the rainy season, as stated above.<br><b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> in accordance with this reasoning, one can pour <b>even a <i>kor</i> and even two <i>kor</i></b> of waste water into a small pit. As all gutters flow with water in the rainy season, there is no cause for any concern.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>And likewise,</b> with regard to <b>two upper stories, one opposite the other</b> in the same courtyard, the residents of the one who dug a pit in the courtyard may pour water into it, while the residents of the other one who did not dig a pit in the courtyard are prohibited from doing so. <b>Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even if</b> the residents of the two upper stories <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> together.<br><b>Abaye said to him: What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>due to the increase</b> in the amount <b>of water,</b> as two upper stories pour out more water than one, <b>wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a pit, and the same</b> applies to <b>a cracked</b> earthenware <b>vessel</b> used as a receptacle for water, or a small <b>pond, or a basin: Even though they were</b> already <b>filled with water on Shabbat eve, one may pour water into them on Shabbat.</b> It is evident from here that as long as the pit is the requisite size, there is no concern about the amount of water that will flow out from it.<br><b>Rather, if it was stated it was stated as follows.
