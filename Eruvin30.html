Daf 30a<br><br><b>But the clothing of the wealthy</b> does <b>not</b> need to be three by three handbreadths in order to become ritually impure <b>for the poor</b> because even smaller pieces of cloth are significant for the poor. Therefore, the law with regard to the poor is not determined by the customary practice of the rich. So too, the law of <i>eiruv</i> pertaining to the rest of the world should not be determined by the customary practice of the Persians to eat roasted meat as a food in itself.<br><b>And if you say:</b> Both <b>here</b> the ruling is <b>stringent,</b> and <b>there</b> the ruling is <b>stringent,</b> i.e., with regard to ritual impurity the <i>halakha</i> is stringent with respect to the poor and declares scraps of cloth that are only three by three fingerbreadths impure, but with regard to <i>eiruv</i> the <i>halakha</i> requires enough roasted meat to suffice for two meals as a food in its own right, in accordance with the practice of the Persians, then there is a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for an ill or elderly</b> person <b>with</b> an amount of <b>food that is enough for him</b> for two meals, and if he eats less than the average person due to his sickness or age, a smaller amount of food is required in order to establish an <i>eiruv</i> on his behalf; <b>however, for a glutton,</b> we do not require food in an amount that would satisfy him but merely enough food for two meals measured according to <b>an average meal for the typical person?</b> This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> with respect to an <i>eiruv</i> is lenient and not stringent. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <b>difficult.</b><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty with the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>Did Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> really <b>say this? Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> pertaining to the laws of ritual impurity that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Og, king of the Bashan,</b> or any similar giant, requires an <b>opening as</b> big as <b>his full size?</b> If a person dies in a house and it is not clear how his corpse will be removed, all of the openings in the house are considered ritually impure, as the corpse might be carried out through any one of them. If the corpse can fit through some of the openings but not through others, only the larger openings are ritually impure. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says that in the case of a giant the size of Og, king of the Bashan, one opening can only prevent the others from contracting impurity if it is large enough for Og’s corpse to fit through. This indicates that the law is determined by the measure of each particular person and not by some general measure.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Abaye</b> say? How does he reconcile his position with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, which maintains that we follow the customary practice of most of the world and not that of particular locales, with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s ruling with regard to the corpse of a giant? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a giant, <b>what should we do? Should we cut</b> the corpse <b>into pieces and carry it out?</b> We have no choice but to carry it out through an opening large enough for the corpse to pass through. However, in the case of the food for the two meals of an <i>eiruv</i>, there is no such logistical constraint, and the law should be determined in accordance with the usual practice.<br><b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, or not? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that which <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Og, king of the Bashan,</b> requires <b>an opening of four</b> handbreadths in order to save the other openings in the house from becoming ritually impure. This indicates that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.<br>The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There,</b> we are dealing with a case <b>where there are many small openings, and there is</b> only <b>one that is four</b> handbreadths wide. Therefore, it may be assumed <b>with certainty that when one widens</b> one of the openings in order to remove the corpse from the house, <b>he will widen that</b> opening. Consequently, that opening is ritually impure while the others are not. However, if all the openings in the house are equal in size, they are all ritually impure, as we cannot know through which opening the corpse will be carried out.<br>Returning to the laws of <i>eiruv</i>, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav Ashi said that Rav said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with raw meat</b> because it can be eaten when necessary, even though it is not ordinarily regarded as food. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said: One may</b> also <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with raw eggs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How many</b> eggs are required for an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: One. Sinai,</b> a nickname of Rav Yosef, <b>said: Two.</b><br>We learned in the mishna: <b>One who vows that nourishment</b> is prohibited to him <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>water</b> and salt. The Gemara infers from this: <b>It is</b> only <b>salt and water</b> that <b>are not considered nourishment, but all</b> other food <b>items are considered nourishment. Let us say</b> that <b>this is a refutation of</b> the position of <b>Rav and Shmuel. As it was Rav and Shmuel who both said: One only recites the blessing: Who creates</b> the various <b>kinds of nourishment, over the five species</b> of grain <b>alone,</b> but not over other types of food.<br>The Gemara asks a question: <b>Did we not</b> already <b>refute</b> their position <b>on one occasion</b> from a different source? The Gemara answers: Indeed, we already refuted their view, but <b>let us say</b> that <b>there is a refutation of their</b> position <b>from here as well.</b><br><b>Rav Huna said:</b> We can resolve the difficulty from the mishna by saying that it is referring to someone who vows and <b>says: Anything that nourishes</b> is prohibited <b>to me.</b> In that case, <b>it is water and salt</b> that are permitted to him, <b>as they do not nourish, but all</b> other food <b>items</b> are prohibited, as they <b>do nourish.</b> This inclusive formulation includes anything that provides even a small degree of nourishment; but the particular term <i>mazon</i>, nourishment or sustenance, used in the blessing over food, is reserved only for the five species of grain.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say: When we were following Rabbi Yoḥanan to eat of the fruits of Genosar,</b> very sweet fruits that grow in the region of the Sea of Galilee, <b>when we were</b> a group <b>of a hundred</b> people, <b>each and every</b> person <b>would take ten</b> fruits; and <b>when we were</b> a group <b>of ten, each and every</b> person <b>would take a hundred</b> fruits for him. <b>And each hundred of these</b> fruits <b>could not fit into a three-<i>se’a</i> basket. And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>would eat them all and</b> then <b>say: I swear that I have not</b> yet <b>tasted something that nourishes.</b> Didn’t we say that only water and salt are excluded from the category of things that nourish? The Gemara corrects the rendition of the story: <b>Say</b> that he said as follows: I have not tasted <b>sustaining food,</b> but fruit is certainly considered something that nourishes.<br><b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If one said: <b>I swear that I shall not eat this loaf, one may</b> nonetheless <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it</b> because the food used for an <i>eiruv</i> does not have to be edible for the particular individual the <i>eiruv</i> services. However, if one said: <b>This loaf</b> shall be forbidden <b>to me, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it,</b> as this formulation indicates that he is prohibiting himself to use or benefit from the loaf in any manner.<br>The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who vows</b> not to benefit <b>from a loaf, one may</b> nonetheless <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it. What, is it not</b> referring to one <b>who said:</b> This loaf shall be forbidden <b>to me?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is only is referring to a case <b>where he said:</b> I swear that I shall not eat <b>this</b> loaf.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the <i>baraita</i> in this fashion, <b>as it was taught in the latter clause: When</b> do we apply this <i>halakha</i>? Only <b>when one said: I swear that I shall not taste it.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if <b>he said:</b> This loaf shall be forbidden <b>to me, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>So too, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it.</b> But <b>if so,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Instead of teaching</b> in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> that if one said: <b>This loaf is consecrated</b> property, <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it, as one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with consecrated</b> objects, <b>let him make</b> an internal <b>distinction in the case</b> of a non-sacred loaf <b>itself</b> and state: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Only where <b>one said:</b> I swear that I shall not eat <b>this</b> loaf. <b>But if one said:</b> This loaf shall be forbidden <b>to me, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it.</b> This indicates that Rav Huna’s understanding of the <i>baraita</i> is incorrect.<br><b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you: Rather, what</b> would you say, that <b>wherever</b> one <b>said:</b> This loaf shall be forbidden <b>to me, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for him with it? If so, there is <b>a difficulty</b> from the <b>first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: When do we say this? Only when one said: I swear that I shall not taste it. That indicates that if one said: This loaf shall be forbidden to me, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it.<br>The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and it teaches the following:</b> With regard to <b>one who vows</b> not to benefit <b>from a loaf, one may</b> nonetheless <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it. And even if one said:</b> This loaf shall be forbidden <b>to me, it is as though he said: I swear that I shall not taste it.</b> Therefore, the loaf itself is only forbidden to him as food, but he can use it for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>Nevertheless,</b> the <b>difficulty</b> remains <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He stated</b> his view <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer; as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If one said: <b>I swear that I shall not eat this loaf, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it;</b> but if he said: <b>This loaf</b> shall be forbidden <b>to me, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rabbi Eliezer</b> really <b>say this? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>a person</b> who <b>prohibits himself from</b> eating a particular <b>food,</b> e.g., if one said: I swear that I shall not eat this loaf, <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with</b> that loaf. However, if the <b>food was prohibited to a person,</b> e.g., if he said: This loaf shall be forbidden to me, <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If he said: <b>This loaf</b> shall be forbidden <b>to me, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it.</b> However, if he said: <b>This loaf is consecrated</b> property, <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with it, as one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for him with consecrated</b> objects. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer does not distinguish between the two differently worded types of vows, but between a vow and consecration.<br>The Gemara answers: It must be explained that these are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> who both held <b>according to Rabbi Eliezer.</b> Two later <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed with each other in reporting Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a nazirite with wine</b> and for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>, even though they themselves may not partake of these foods. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> was <b>not</b> taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a nazirite with wine and for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>. Beit Hillel</b> disagree and <b>say: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a nazirite with wine and for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>. Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: Do you not concede</b><br><br>Daf 30b<br><br><b>that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for an adult</b> even <b>on Yom Kippur,</b> despite the fact that he may not eat on Yom Kippur? It must be because eating is permitted to a minor.<br>Beit Shammai <b>said to them: Indeed [<i>aval</i>],</b> it is so. Beit Hillel <b>said to them: Just as one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for an adult on Yom Kippur, so</b> too, <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a nazirite with wine and for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>.</b><br><b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Shammai</b> explain the difference between these cases? The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>there is</b> at least <b>a meal that was fit</b> to be eaten by that person <b>while it was still day,</b> on the eve of Yom Kippur. <b>Here,</b> in the cases of wine for a nazirite and <i>teruma</i> for an Israelite, <b>there is no meal that was fit</b> to be eaten by them <b>while it was still day,</b> on Friday.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was that entire <i>baraita</i> stated? It was <b>not</b> taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, as it was taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says: The whole</b> view <b>of Beit Shammai,</b> i.e., their fundamental position, was that <b>they did not concede to</b> the very possibility of <b>joining</b> Shabbat borders [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] by simply placing food in a particular location. Rather, they hold that one’s Shabbat residence remains the same <b>until</b> he literally moves his residence, such as if <b>he carries out his bed and his utensils to there,</b> to a new location.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is</b> the ruling <b>that was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one established an <i>eiruv</i> in black</b> clothing, and Shabbat commenced while he was still dressed those clothes, <b>he may not go out in white</b> clothing. If one established the <i>eiruv</i> while dressed <b>in white, he may not go out in black. According to whose</b> opinion is this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya,</b> is it <b>with black</b> clothing that <b>he may not go out, but in white</b> clothing <b>he may go out? Didn’t</b> Ḥananya <b>say</b> that according to Beit Shammai an <i>eiruv</i> is not effective at all <b>until one carries out his bed and his utensils</b> to the place he wishes to establish as his residence? The Gemara answers: The wording of the <i>baraita</i> must be emended and <b>this is what it said:</b> If <b>one established an <i>eiruv</i></b> while dressed <b>in white</b> clothing, <b>and he needed black</b> clothing but did not have it with him, <b>he may not go out even in white</b> clothing. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this <i>baraita</i> taught? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b><br>We learned in the mishna: <b>Summakhos</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> One may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>, but only <b>with</b> regular, <b>non-sacred</b> food items. The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> with regard to the mishna’s ruling that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established for <b>a nazirite with wine,</b> Summakhos <b>does not</b> appear to <b>disagree. What is the reason</b> for the distinction? The Gemara explains: A nazirite <b>can ask</b> a Sage to annul his vow and release him from <b>his nazirite status,</b> and then he himself will be able to drink the wine.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> in the case of <b><i>teruma</i> as well, one can ask</b> a Sage to annul <b>its</b> status. <i>Teruma</i> is consecrated through a verbal declaration by the one separating it, and that declaration, like other consecrations and vows, can be nullified by a Sage. The Gemara answers: Such a course of action would not help. <b>If one asks</b> a Sage to annul his declaration that turned the produce into <i>teruma</i>, the produce <b>will return to</b> its status as <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> produce from which the requisite dues and tithes were not separated, and he will still be prohibited to consume it.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Let him separate</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>for</b> that produce <b>from</b> produce located <b>somewhere else</b> and thus permit it to be eaten. The Gemara answers: <b><i>Ḥaverim</i>,</b> members of a group dedicated to the precise observance of mitzvot, <b>are not suspected of separating</b> <i>teruma</i> from produce that is <b>not</b> situated <b>near</b> the produce it comes to exempt, as this is prohibited <i>ab initio</i>.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Let him separate</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> the produce used for the <i>eiruv</i> <b>itself</b> and consequently permit the rest of the produce to be eaten. The Gemara answers: We are dealing with a case <b>where,</b> after removing <i>teruma</i>, <b>it would not contain the amount</b> required for an <i>eiruv</i>, i.e., one would be left with less than the quantity of food sufficient for two meals.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> makes it <b>necessary</b> to say that the mishna is referring to this very unique case? <b>Rather,</b> we must retract all that was stated above and say as follows: <b>Summakhos agrees with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: Anything that is</b> prohibited on Shabbat <b>due to a rabbinic decree [<i>shevut</i>],</b> the Sages <b>issued the decree</b> to apply even <b>during twilight.</b> Even though this period is of questionable status with regard to whether it is day or night, the Shabbat restrictions instituted by the Sages apply then as they do on Shabbat itself. Consequently, since it is prohibited to separate <i>teruma</i> on Shabbat, it is prohibited during the twilight period as well. Therefore, during twilight, when the <i>eiruv</i> would go into effect, it is impossible to cause it to become permitted to an Israelite.<br>The Gemara now asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is</b> the ruling <b>that we learned</b> in the following mishna: <b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> with regard to which <b>they stated</b> that measures <b>are all in accordance with the</b> particular <b>person</b> involved, e.g., <b>the handful of</b> flour that a priest scoops out from <b>a meal-offering, and the handfuls of incense</b> the High Priest would offer on Yom Kippur, <b>and one who drinks a cheekful on Yom Kippur, and with regard to the</b> measure of <b>two meals’</b> worth of <b>nourishment for an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> All these measures are determined by the particular individual involved. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Summakhos, who said: We require that which is fit for him,</b> the particular individual, and we do not follow a standard measure.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the aforementioned mishna <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for an ill or elderly</b> person <b>with</b> an amount of <b>food that is enough for him</b> for two meals; and if he eats less than the average amount due to his sickness or age, a smaller amount of food is sufficient. <b>But for a glutton</b> we do not require food in an amount that would satisfy him; we measure on the basis of <b>an average meal for the typical person.</b><br>The Gemara answers: When the mishna says that the measure of food for two meals is determined by the particular person involved, <b>interpret</b> that as referring to <b>an ill or elderly</b> person. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a glutton,</b> we do not determine the measure of food by his standard for a different reason, namely because <b>his opinion is rendered irrelevant by the opinions of all other people.</b> Therefore, there is no reason to be stringent with him and determine the measure according to his particular needs.<br>We learned in the mishna: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>for a priest in a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> an area in which there is doubt concerning the location of a grave or a corpse. The Gemara explains that the reason for this is as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> In a time of need <b>a person may blow</b> on the dust in a <b><i>beit haperas</i></b> before taking each step, so that if there is a bone beneath the dust he will expose it and avoid it, <b>and</b> he may thus <b>walk</b> across the area. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ami said in the name of Rav Yehuda: A <i>beit haperas</i> that has been trodden</b> underfoot, creating a path, <b>is pure,</b> as we assume that it no longer contains any bones as large as a kernel of barley. Both of these statements indicate that the ritual impurity of a <i>beit haperas</i> is a stringency decreed by the Sages. Therefore, since there is a way to avoid becoming ritually impure there, even a priest may place his <i>eiruv</i> in a <i>beit haperas</i>.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> An <i>eiruv</i> may be established for a priest <b>even</b> in <b>a cemetery,</b> an area which the priest may not enter by Torah law. <b>It was taught:</b> This is permitted <b>because</b> the priest <b>can interpose and walk</b> between the graves inside <b>a carriage, a crate, or a cupboard.</b> These containers do not contract impurity because of their large size, and anything found inside of them remains pure. From here we see that <b>he holds</b> the following: <b>A moving tent is called a tent,</b> and therefore the carriage, box, or cupboard are also considered tents. They shield a person carried in them from the impurity imparted by the graves in a cemetery.<br>The Gemara notes that this matter is the subject of <b>a dispute between the following <i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who enters the land of the nations,</b> i.e., any territory outside Eretz Yisrael, not on foot, but <b>in a carriage, a crate, or a cupboard, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>renders</b> him ritually <b>impure. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, renders</b> him <b>pure.</b><br>The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>a moving tent is not called a tent.</b> The principle is that only something fixed can shield against ritual impurity, but if one is situated inside a portable vessel, the vessel contracts impurity and he becomes impure along with it. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>a moving tent is called a tent,</b> and it shields the person inside from contracting ritual impurity.<br><b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b><br><br></body></html>
