Daf 56a<br><br><b>coarse bread,</b> made from coarse flour that has not been thoroughly sifted, <b>new beer, and vegetables.</b> This indicates that vegetables are harmful to one’s well-being. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of Rav Huna is referring <b>to garlic and leeks,</b> which are beneficial; <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to other vegetables,</b> which are harmful. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Garlic is</b> a healthy <b>vegetable; leeks</b> are <b>a half-vegetable,</b> meaning they are half as healthful. If <b>radish has been seen, an elixir of life has been seen,</b> as it is very beneficial to the body.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: If <b>radish has been seen, a lethal drug has been seen?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that deprecates radish, it is referring <b>to</b> its <b>leaves; there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that praises radish, it is referring <b>to the roots.</b> Alternatively, <b>here</b> it is referring <b>to the summer,</b> when radish is beneficial; <b>there,</b> it is referring <b>to the winter,</b> when it is harmful.<br>On the topic of the attributes of different locations, <b>Rav Yehuda</b> also <b>said that Rav said:</b> In <b>any city that has</b> many <b>ascents and descents,</b> which can be taxing to the body, <b>people and animals die at half their days,</b> meaning half of their life expectancy. The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that Rav really meant to say that they <b>die</b> prematurely? Even in such cities they are known to have a regular life expectancy. <b>Rather, say: They grow old at half their days,</b> i.e., they age prematurely due to the strain of climbing up and down the inclines. Similarly, <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: The ascents</b> and descents <b>between Beit Biri and Beit Neresh,</b> my place of residence, <b>made me grow old</b> prematurely.<br>With regard to the measurements of a city’s boundaries, <b>the Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If, in order to measure the Shabbat limit, <b>one comes to square</b> a city, i.e., to extend the city’s boundaries to include all of its protrusions within an imaginary square, <b>he squares it</b> so that the sides of the square align <b>with the four</b> directions <b>of the world. He sets the northern</b> side of the square <b>to</b> align with <b>the north of the world, and its southern</b> side <b>to</b> align with <b>the south of the world. And your sign</b> by which you can recognize the directions of the world is as follows: The constellation of <b>Ursa Major is in the north and Scorpio is in the south.</b> The directions of the city are determined by these constellations.<br><b>Rabbi Yosei says: If one does not know how to square</b> the city in alignment <b>with the four</b> directions <b>of the world</b> based upon the constellations, <b>he should square it based upon the seasons,</b> although this is less precise. <b>How so?</b> Where <b>the sun rises and sets on the longest day</b> of the year, the summer solstice, <b>this</b> route of the sun <b>is the face of the north.</b> The sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest, and thus travels from east to west across the north side of the world. Conversely, where <b>the sun rises and sets on the shortest day</b> of the year, the winter solstice, <b>this</b> route of the sun <b>is the face of the south.</b> Whereas at <b>the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox,</b> when day and night are equal in length, <b>the sun rises in the middle of the east and sets in the middle of the west.</b><br><b>As it is stated:</b> “One generation passes away and another generation comes; but the earth abides forever. The sun also rises and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place, where it rises again. <b>It goes toward the south, and turns about to the north;</b> round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns” (Ecclesiastes 1:4–6). The verse is understood as describing the sun’s movements, as follows: <b>“It goes toward the south” during the day; “and turns about to the north,”</b> on the other side of the earth, <b>at night. “Round and round goes the wind [<i>ruaḥ</i>];”</b> the word <i>ruaḥ</i> can also mean direction or side. Rabbi Yosei explains that <b>these are the face of the east and the face of the west; sometimes</b> the sun <b>traverses them</b> visibly, <b>and sometimes it turns about them</b> without being seen.<br><b>Rav Mesharshiya said: There is no</b> validity to these <b>rules</b> established by Rabbi Yosei, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The sun has never risen,</b> even during the summer, <b>at the northeastern corner</b> of the sky <b>and set in the northwestern corner, nor has the sun</b> ever <b>risen,</b> even during the winter, <b>at the southeastern corner and set in the southwestern corner.</b> Therefore, one can establish the directions of the world according to the sun’s path only during the autumn and spring.<br>On the topic of the previous discussion with regard to calculating the directions of the world based upon the seasons, <b>Shmuel said: The vernal equinox occurs only at</b> the beginning of one of <b>the four quarters of a day: Either</b> precisely <b>at the beginning of the day, or</b> precisely <b>at the beginning of the night, or at midday, or at midnight.</b><br>Similarly, <b>the summer solstice occurs only</b> at certain times of the day: <b>Either at</b> the conclusion of <b>one and a half</b> hours <b>or seven and a half</b> hours <b>of the day or night. And the autumnal equinox occurs only</b> at certain times: <b>Either at</b> the conclusion of <b>three hours or nine hours of the day or night. And the winter solstice occurs only</b> at certain times: <b>Either at</b> the conclusion of <b>four and a half</b> hours <b>or ten and a half</b> hours <b>of the day or night.</b><br><b>And</b> all this is based on the principle that <b>there are only ninety-one days and seven and a half hours between</b> the beginning of <b>one season and the next,</b> as he assumed that a year is exactly 365¼ days. <b>And</b> similarly, each <b>season</b> begins precisely <b>one-half</b> planetary <b>hour past the</b> beginning of the <b>previous season.</b> There are seven heavenly bodies that are each ascendant for an hour at a time in a constant rotation: Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, and Venus. Each season begins half an hour later in this rotation than <b>the previous</b> season.<br><b>And Shmuel said: There is no</b> instance when the <b>vernal equinox occurs in</b> the planetary hour of <b>Jupiter</b> and <b>it does not break the trees</b> with its strong winds; <b>and there is no</b> instance when <b>the winter solstice occurs in</b> the planetary hour of <b>Jupiter</b> and <b>it does not dry up the seeds. And this</b> applies only <b>where the new moon appeared either at</b> the hour of the <b>Moon or at</b> the hour of <b>Jupiter.</b><br><br>Daf 56b<br><br><b>The Sages taught: One who squares a city</b> in order to determine its Shabbat limit <b>renders it like a square tablet, and then</b> he also <b>squares the</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries and renders them like a square tablet.</b> Consequently, after squaring the city, he adds additional squares of two thousand cubits to each of its sides.<br><b>And when he measures</b> the Shabbat limit, <b>he should not measure</b> the <b>two thousand cubits</b> diagonally <b>from the middle of</b> each <b>corner</b> of the city, <b>because</b> if he were to do so, <b>he would lose the corners,</b> i.e., the limit would extend only two thousand cubits on the diagonal from each of the corners. <b>Rather,</b> he measures the boundary as though <b>he brought a square tablet that is two thousand cubits by two thousand cubits, and places it at</b> each <b>corner at its diagonal.</b><br>As a result, <b>it will be found</b> that <b>the city gains four hundred cubits in this</b> corner <b>and</b> another <b>four hundred cubits in the</b> opposite corner. Assuming that the city itself is round and has a diameter of two thousand cubits, as will be explained below, when the borders of the city are squared, approximately four hundred cubits are added to the city at each corner. When one then squares the Shabbat boundaries, <b>it is found</b> that the Shabbat <b>boundaries gain eight hundred cubits in this</b> corner <b>and eight hundred cubits in the</b> opposite corner. Consequently, by squaring both the city itself and its Shabbat boundaries, <b>it is found</b> that <b>the city and the</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries</b> together <b>gain 1,200</b> cubits <b>in this</b> corner <b>and 1,200</b> cubits <b>in the</b> opposite corner.<br><b>Abaye said: And you find this</b> projection of the additions to the city’s borders and Shabbat boundaries to be correct <b>in</b> the case of a round <b>city that is two thousand</b> cubits <b>by two thousand</b> cubits.<br>The Gemara cites a similar discussion with regard to the Levite cities, the forty-eight cities given to the Levites in Eretz Yisrael instead of a tribal inheritance. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: The boundary of the cities of the Levites</b> extends <b>two thousand cubits</b> in each direction beyond the inhabited section of the city. <b>Remove from them a thousand cubits of open space</b> just beyond the inhabited area, which must be left vacant. <b>Consequently, the open space is one quarter</b> of the extended area, <b>and the rest is fields and vineyards.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters?</b> From where is it derived that the open space surrounding the cities of the Levites measured a thousand cubits? <b>Rava said: As the verse states:</b> “And the open spaces of the cities, that you shall give to the Levites, <b>shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about”</b> (Numbers 35:4). <b>The Torah states: Surround the city with a thousand</b> cubits on all sides to serve as an open space. <b>Consequently, the open space is one quarter</b> of the area.<br>The Gemara asks: Is it <b>one quarter? It is one half.</b> One thousand cubits is exactly half of the two thousand cubits incorporated into the boundary of the cities of the Levites. <b>Rava said: Bar Adda the surveyor explained</b> the calculation <b>to me: You will find</b> this <b>in a city that is two thousand</b> cubits <b>by two thousand</b> cubits. <b>How many</b> cubits is the extended <b>boundary</b> of the city itself, without the corners? <b>Sixteen</b> million square cubits. Squares measuring two thousand by two thousand cubits are appended to each of the four sides of the city. The area of each of these squares is four million square cubits, and the total area of all the additional squares is sixteen million square cubits. <b>How many</b> cubits <b>are the corners? Sixteen</b> million square cubits, as additional squares of two thousand by two thousand cubits are appended to the corners of the outer boundaries of the cities. <b>Subtract eight</b> million square cubits <b>from the</b> area of the extended <b>boundary</b> for the open space around the city; the first thousand cubits beyond the inhabited part of the city must be left as open space, which amounts to areas measuring one thousand by two thousand cubits on each of the four sides of the city, for a total of eight million square cubits. <b>And</b> subtract another <b>four</b> million square cubits <b>from the corners,</b> as sections of the corners are parallel to the open spaces. <b>How much is</b> the sum total of the area of the open spaces? <b>Twelve</b> million square cubits.<br>The Gemara asks: According to this calculation, how is <b>the open space found</b> to be <b>one quarter</b> of the area? <b>It is more than one-third.</b> The entire area of the extended boundary is thirty-two million square cubits and the open space occupies twelve million square cubits, which is more than one-third of the total area of the extended boundary.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>Bring the four</b> million square cubits <b>of the city</b> itself and <b>add them</b> to the area of the limit, and you will arrive at the correct ratio. The Gemara asks: The opens space <b>is still one-third,</b> as the total area of the city and its extended boundary is thirty-six million square cubits, and the area of the open space is twelve million square cubits.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Do you think</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>was stated</b> with regard <b>to a square</b> city? <b>It was</b> in fact <b>stated</b> with regard <b>to a round</b> city. The open space beyond the city is also round; however, the total extended boundary is squared, so that the total area of a round city with a diameter of two thousand cubits and its extended boundary is thirty-six million square cubits.<br>The Gemara explains the calculation: <b>How much larger is</b> the area of <b>a square than</b> the area of <b>the circle? One quarter. Subtract one quarter from</b> the twelve million square cubits of open space, and <b>nine</b> million square cubits <b>are left; and nine is</b> precisely <b>one quarter of thirty-six.</b><br><b>Abaye said: You will also find</b> that the open space is one quarter of the total area <b>in a city that is a thousand</b> cubits <b>by a thousand</b> cubits. <b>How many</b> cubits <b>is the</b> extended <b>boundary</b> of the city without the corners? It is <b>eight</b> million square cubits. Additional areas are appended along each side of the city and extending two thousand cubits beyond the city itself. Each of these areas is two thousand cubits by one thousand cubits, for a total area of two million square cubits. Since there are four of these zones, their total area is eight million square cubits. <b>How many</b> cubits <b>are the corners?</b> They are <b>sixteen</b> million square cubits, as squares of two thousand cubits by two thousand cubits are added to each of the four corners.<br><br></body></html>
