Daf 49a<br><br><b>This</b> teaching, that carrying objects from either of the outer courtyards into the middle courtyard is permitted, is <b>also the statement of,</b> i.e., in accordance with, the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. But the Rabbis say: All three</b> courtyards <b>are prohibited,</b> that is to say, carrying is prohibited from any of the courtyards to any of the others.<br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to three courtyards that open into one another, and that</b> also <b>open into a public domain. If the two</b> outer courtyards <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with the middle</b> one, a resident of one of the outer courtyards <b>may bring</b> food <b>from a house</b> in that courtyard <b>and eat</b> it in the middle courtyard, <b>and</b> likewise a resident of the other courtyard <b>may bring</b> food <b>from a house</b> in that courtyard <b>and eat</b> it in the middle courtyard. And similarly, <b>this</b> resident <b>may bring leftovers</b> from the house where he ate <b>back into</b> the <b>house</b> in that courtyard, <b>and that resident may bring leftovers</b> from the house where he ate <b>back into</b> the <b>house</b> in this courtyard.<br><b>However, the Rabbis say: All three</b> courtyards <b>are prohibited.</b> Since the residents of the outer courtyards are prohibited to carry from one outer courtyard to the other, this results in a place where carrying is prohibited, and such a place prohibits carrying in all three courtyards.<br>The Gemara notes that <b>Shmuel follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> that he used elsewhere, as <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard that is between two alleyways,</b> if that courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with both</b> alleyways, <b>it is prohibited with both of them.</b> Since the residents of the two alleyways are prohibited to carry from one to the other and the <i>eiruv</i> enables the residents of the two alleyways to carry in the courtyard, it is prohibited to carry from the courtyard into the alleyways, so that the residents of the alleyways do not transfer objects from one alleyway to the other via the courtyard.<br>If the courtyard <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with either</b> alleyway, <b>it prohibits</b> one to carry in <b>both of them.</b> Since the residents of the courtyard were accustomed to utilizing both alleyways and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with either alleyway, the result is that each alleyway has a courtyard that did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, which prohibits carrying from the courtyard into either alleyway.<br>If, however, the residents of the courtyard were <b>accustomed to utilizing</b> only <b>one</b> alleyway, while <b>they</b> are <b>not accustomed to utilizing one</b> alleyway, then with regard to the alleyway <b>which</b> they are <b>accustomed to utilizing,</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry there, as the residents of the courtyard did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with it. <b>But</b> with regard to the alleyway <b>which</b> they are <b>not accustomed to utilizing,</b> it <b>is permitted</b> to carry there, as the residents of the courtyard are not considered residents of that alleyway.<br><b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to residents of a courtyard who <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with</b> the alleyway <b>which</b> they <b>were not accustomed to utilizing,</b> the alleyway <b>which</b> they <b>were accustomed to utilizing is permitted</b> to establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>on its own</b> without the courtyard. The residents of the courtyard have demonstrated their intention to use the other alleyway, despite their not being accustomed to doing so.<br><b>And Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If</b> the alleyway <b>which</b> the residents of the courtyard <b>were accustomed to utilizing established an <i>eiruv</i> on its own</b> without the courtyard, <b>while</b> the alleyway <b>which</b> they <b>were not accustomed to utilizing did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, and</b> also the courtyard <b>itself did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with either alleyway, <b>we divert</b> the residents of the courtyard to use the alleyway <b>which</b> they are <b>not accustomed to utilizing.</b> This is because there is one alleyway in which it is prohibited to carry due to the lack of an <i>eiruv</i>, and a second alleyway in which it is permitted to carry; while it is prohibited for the residents of the courtyard to carry. As explained above, were they to utilize the alleyway which they are accustomed to utilizing, the other residents of the alleyway would also be prohibited to carry from their courtyards into the alleyway, despite having established an <i>eiruv</i> for their own alleyway. However, if they use the other alleyway, the residents of that alleyway will not lose anything; since they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, it is prohibited for them to carry in that alleyway regardless.<br><b>In a case such as this, one compels</b> another to refrain from behavior <b>characteristic of Sodom.</b> We force a person to waive his legal rights in order to prevent him from acting in a manner characteristic of the wicked city of Sodom. If one denies another use of his possessions, even though he would incur no loss or damage by granting use of his property, his conduct is considered to be characteristic of Sodom. The courts may sometimes compel such a person to waive his legal rights.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>one who is particular about his <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., that the other people should not eat of the food he contributed, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> After all, <b>what is its name? Joining [<i>eiruv</i>] is its name,</b> indicating that it must be jointly owned [<i>me’urav</i>] by all the participants in the <i>eiruv</i>. If one person does not allow the other participants to eat of it, it does not belong to all of them and cannot be called an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> Even in that case, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>, however,</b> that person <b>is called</b> one <b>of the men of Vardina.</b> The men of Vardina were renowned misers, meaning that he is considered to be like them.<br><b>Rav Yehuda</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>one who divides his <i>eiruv</i></b> into two parts, his <i>eiruv</i> <b>is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> This is for the aforementioned reason that, by definition, an <i>eiruv</i> needs to be indicative of joining, and this <i>eiruv</i> is separated into different parts.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Shmuel state this teaching? Could it be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>five</b> people who <b>collected their <i>eiruv</i> and placed it in two</b> separate <b>utensils, Beit Shammai say: This is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>, whereas Beit Hillel say: This is an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> It does not stand to reason that Shmuel would follow Beit Shammai, whose opinion is not accepted as normative law.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Even if you say</b> that Shmuel stated his opinion in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, Beit Hillel stated</b> their opinion <b>only there, where the</b> first <b>utensil was filled and there was</b> still some food <b>left over,</b> and therefore, some of the leftover food had to be placed in a second utensil. <b>But where they divided it</b> from the outset, even Beit Hillel agree that the <i>eiruv</i> is <b>not</b> valid.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need two</b> rulings that are based on the same principle, i.e., that an <i>eiruv</i> must demonstrate joining? The Gemara answers: Both rulings were <b>necessary. As, had</b> the Gemara <b>taught us</b> the ruling only <b>there,</b> with regard to one who is particular about his <i>eiruv</i>, one might have said that the <i>eiruv</i> is not valid <b>because</b> the person <b>is particular</b> and expressly does not desire that his <i>eiruv</i> be eaten by others. <b>However here,</b> with regard to one who divides the <i>eiruv</i> into different parts, one might <b>say</b> that his portion should <b>not</b> be considered as separated from the rest.<br><b>And had</b> the Gemara <b>taught us</b> the ruling only <b>here,</b> with regard to one who divides his <i>eiruv</i>, one might have said that the <i>eiruv</i> is not valid <b>because he divided it up,</b> thereby physically separating himself from the others. <b>However there,</b> with regard to one who is particular about his <i>eiruv</i>, one might <b>say</b> that his portion should <b>not</b> be considered as separated from the rest, since no act of separation was performed. Consequently, both rulings were <b>necessary.</b><br><b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Yehuda in the olive press in Rav Zakkai’s house: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that in the case of <b>one who divides his <i>eiruv</i>, it is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>? Didn’t Shmuel say</b> elsewhere: <b>The house in which the <i>eiruv</i> is placed need not contribute bread</b> for the <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>Is it not because</b> Shmuel <b>maintains</b> that <b>since</b> there is bread <b>lying in a basket</b> somewhere in the house, <b>it is</b> regarded <b>as if it were placed here</b> with the rest of the <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Here too,</b> one should say that <b>since</b> the bread <b>is placed in a basket,</b> i.e., in one of the two utensils containing the <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it is</b> regarded <b>as if it were placed here</b> with the rest of the <i>eiruv</i>.<br>Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: There</b> Shmuel validates the <i>eiruv</i> <b>although there is no bread</b> in the house in which the <i>eiruv</i> is deposited. And <b>what is the reason</b> for his ruling? It is <b>because</b> by placing food in a particular house, <b>all</b> the residents of the courtyard <b>are</b> regarded <b>as living here.</b> Therefore, those living in that house need not contribute bread for the <i>eiruv</i>, as they are certainly residents of the house.<br><b>Shmuel said: An <i>eiruv</i></b> that is deposited in a house is effective <b>due to</b> the principle of <b>acquisition,</b> as each person who contributes a portion of food acquires the right to a certain use of the residence and is considered one of its residents.<br><b>And if you say: Why</b> then <b>can one not acquire</b> this right <b>through</b> payment of a coin such as <b>a <i>ma’a</i>,</b> but rather only through bread? It is <b>because</b> a <i>ma’a</i> <b>is not</b> always <b>available on Shabbat eve,</b> as many people spend all of their available money for the necessities of Shabbat, and it is difficult to find money available at that hour.<br>The Gemara asks: If so, according to Shmuel’s opinion, in a case <b>where he established an <i>eiruv</i></b> with money, <b>it should nonetheless acquire,</b> i.e., be valid. According to his opinion, there is no fundamental reason to invalidate the acquisition of rights in the residence through the payment of money, yet there is no indication that this position is valid.<br>The Gemara answers: Even Shmuel did not permit one to establish an <i>eiruv</i> with money, due to <b>a decree lest</b> people <b>say that a <i>ma’a</i> is essential, and sometimes a <i>ma’a</i> will not be available, and they will not come</b> to prepare <b>an <i>eiruv</i> with bread, and</b> the halakhic category of <b><i>eiruv</i> will be forgotten.</b><br><b>Rabba</b> disagreed with Shmuel and <b>said: An <i>eiruv</i></b> is effective <b>due to</b> the principle of <b>residence.</b> Each person who contributes a portion of food is considered as if he resides, for that Shabbat, in the residence in which the food is deposited.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical, halakhic difference <b>between these</b> two understandings? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the question of whether an <i>eiruv</i> may be established with <b>a utensil.</b> If an <i>eiruv</i> is effective based on the principle of acquisition, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, then one should be able to establish an <i>eiruv</i> with a utensil; whereas, this would not constitute a valid <i>eiruv</i>, according to the opinion of Rabba.<br><b>And</b> another practical difference between them is with regard to whether an <i>eiruv</i> may be established with food that is <b>less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>.</b> According to Shmuel’s opinion, this would not be a valid <i>eiruv</i>, as there is no acquisition with something less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>; whereas according to Rabba’s opinion, since an <i>eiruv</i> is effective by establishing a person’s residence, this can be done even with an amount of food worth less than a <i>peruta</i>.<br><br>Daf 49b<br><br><b>And</b> there is another practical difference between them with regard to the question whether <b>a minor</b> may collect the <i>eiruv</i> from the residents of the courtyard and deposit it in one of the houses. According to Shmuel’s opinion, this would not be a valid <i>eiruv</i>, for a minor cannot serve as an agent to effect acquisition, whereas according to Rabba’s opinion, the <i>eiruv</i> is valid, as the food itself establishes the common residence for all the residents.<br><b>Abaye said to Rabba: It is difficult according to your</b> opinion that an <i>eiruv</i> is effective based on the principle of residence, <b>and it is difficult according to</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel</b> that it is effective based on the principle of acquisition. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>five</b> people <b>who collected their <i>eiruv</i>, when they take their <i>eiruv</i> elsewhere,</b> in order to establish an <i>eiruv</i> together with another courtyard, <b>one</b> person may <b>take it</b> there <b>for all of them.</b> This indicates that <b>it is</b> only <b>that person who acquires</b> rights, <b>and nobody else,</b> and <b>it is</b> only <b>that person who gains residence, and nobody else.</b> In that case, how can the others rely on this <i>eiruv</i>?<br>Rabba said <b>to him:</b> It is <b>neither difficult according to my</b> opinion, <b>nor</b> is it <b>difficult according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> as, the person who takes the <i>eiruv</i> <b>acts as an agent,</b> effecting acquisition or determining residence <b>on behalf of all of them.</b><br>With regard to the case of the three courtyards addressed above, <b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> that it is permitted to carry from the middle courtyard into either of the two outer ones; and vice versa, however, it is prohibited to carry from one outer courtyard to the other.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who was coming along the way</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling, <b>and he was familiar</b> with <b>a tree or a fence</b> located two thousand cubits from his current location, and two thousand cubits from his house, <b>and he said: My residence is beneath</b> that tree, rather than in his present location, <b>he has not said anything,</b> as he did not establish a fixed location as his residence.<br>If, however, he said: <b>My residence is at</b> the tree’s <b>trunk,</b> he acquired residence there, and he <b>may</b> therefore <b>walk from the place he is standing to the trunk</b> of the tree <b>two thousand cubits</b> away, <b>and from the trunk</b> of the tree <b>to his house,</b> an additional <b>two thousand cubits. Consequently, he walks after nightfall</b> a total of <b>four thousand cubits.</b><br><b>If one is not familiar</b> with a tree or any other noticeable landmark, <b>or if he is not an expert in the <i>halakha</i>,</b> unaware that residence can be established from a distance, <b>and he said: My residence is at my</b> current <b>location,</b> then his presence at <b>his</b> current <b>location acquires for him</b> the right to walk <b>two thousand cubits in each direction.</b><br>The manner in which the two thousand cubits are measured is the subject of a tannaitic dispute. These cubits are measured <b>circularly,</b> i.e., as a circle with a radius of two thousand cubits; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigenos. And the Rabbis say:</b> These are measured <b>squarely,</b> i.e., <b>as a square tablet,</b> with each side measuring four thousand cubits, <b>so that he gains the corners.</b> He is permitted to walk from the middle to the corners of the square as well, a distance of approximately 2,800 cubits.<br><b>And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said: The pauper establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet,</b> i.e., one who does not have the bread required to establish an <i>eiruv</i> may walk anywhere within his Shabbat limit and declare: This is my residence, and his Shabbat limit is measured from that location. <b>Rabbi Meir said: We have</b> this leniency in effect <b>only</b> for <b>a pauper,</b> who does not have food for two meals. However, one who has bread may only establish residence with bread. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This leniency is in effect for <b>both a pauper and a wealthy person.</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with bread only</b> in order <b>to be lenient with the wealthy</b> person, <b>so that he</b> need <b>not</b> exert himself and <b>go out and establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet.</b> Instead, he can appoint an agent to place bread for him in that location. This, however, does not negate the option of personally going to that location in order to establish residence without bread.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that one who declares his intention to establish residence beneath a tree, without specifying the precise location, has not said anything. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the precise meaning of <b>he has not said anything?</b><br><b>Rav said: He has not said anything at all,</b> and has failed to establish residence anywhere, and <b>he may not even go to</b> the place <b>beneath</b> that <b>tree.</b> His failure to specify a particular location prevents him from establishing residence beneath the tree. The fact that he sought to establish residence someplace other than his present location prevents him from establishing residence at his present location. Accordingly, he may walk no more than four cubits from the place that he is standing.<br><b>And Shmuel said: He has not said anything</b> with regard to going <b>to his home,</b> if it is two thousand cubits past the tree; <b>however,</b> with regard to the area <b>beneath the tree,</b> if its bough is entirely within two thousand cubits of his present location <b>he may</b> indeed <b>go</b> there.<br><b>And</b> when we learned in the mishna that he did not establish residence, it means that the legal status of the area <b>beneath the tree becomes</b> comparable to both <b>a donkey driver,</b> who walks behind the animal and prods it, <b>and a camel driver,</b> who walks before the animal and leads it in the sense that the tree is pulling him in both directions. Since he did not specify a particular location as his residence, any part of the area beneath the tree could be the place where he established residence.<br>Therefore, if <b>he comes to measure</b> two thousand cubits <b>from the north</b> of the tree in order to ascertain whether or not he may go to his home, because of the uncertainty with regard to the precise location where he established residence, <b>one measures</b> the distance <b>for him</b> stringently <b>from the south.</b> And likewise, if <b>he comes to measure</b> the distance to his home <b>from the south, one measures</b> the distance <b>for him from the north.</b><br><br></body></html>
