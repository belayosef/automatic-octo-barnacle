Daf 34a<br><br><b>Why</b> must one actually bring the <i>eiruv</i> to the place where he wishes to establish his residence? <b>Let us say: Since if he wished to bring</b> the <i>eiruv</i> there <b>he could bring it, even though he did not bring it, it is considered as though he did bring it</b> there. This follows the same reasoning proposed by Rav Yirmeya in the case of the basket: Since one can tilt it. The fact that this reasoning is not employed here indicates that the potential to do something is insufficient; rather, the deed must actually be done.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The fact that one must bring his <i>eiruv</i> the day before to the spot that he wishes to establish as his place of residence, and the potential to bring it there does not suffice, is <b>a decree due to a Festival that occurs after Shabbat.</b> In that case, the <i>eiruv</i> is valid for the Festival only if it was brought there before Shabbat, for it cannot be carried there on Shabbat. Since one cannot actually bring the <i>eiruv</i> there, it cannot be said: It is considered as though he did bring it there because had he wished to bring the <i>eiruv</i> he could have. Consequently, the Sages decreed that in all cases, the <i>eiruv</i> is only valid if it was actually brought to the designated spot, lest one come to think that even on a Festival that occurs after Shabbat it need not be brought there.<br>Rav bar Shabba <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>intended to establish his Shabbat residence in the public domain and placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a wall</b> that is more than four cubits away from that location; if he placed the <i>eiruv</i> <b>below</b> a height of <b>ten handbreadths</b> above the ground, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> but if he placed it <b>above ten handbreadths, his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i></b> because he is in a public domain while his <i>eiruv</i> is in a private domain. If <b>one intended to establish his Shabbat residence on top of a dovecote or on top of</b> a large <b>cupboard,</b> if he placed the <i>eiruv</i> in the dovecote or cupboard <b>above ten handbreadths</b> from the ground, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i></b> because both he and his <i>eiruv</i> are in a private domain; but if he placed it <b>below ten handbreadths,</b> the area in which he placed his <i>eiruv</i> is considered a <i>karmelit</i>, and <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i></b> because he cannot transport his <i>eiruv</i> from there to his own domain on Shabbat.<br><b>Why</b> should this be so? <b>Here too, let us say</b> that his <i>eiruv</i> should be valid even if it was placed below ten handbreadths, <b>since one can tilt</b> the cupboard <b>and bring it to within ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, in which case he and his <i>eiruv</i> would be in the same domain. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Here, we are dealing with a cupboard that is nailed</b> to the wall so that it cannot be tilted.<br><b>Rava said: Even if you say</b> that it is referring to <b>a cupboard that is not nailed</b> to the wall, <b>here, we are dealing with</b> a very <b>tall cupboard,</b> such <b>that were one to tilt it a little</b> in order to bring the top of the cupboard within ten handbreadths from the ground, the top of the cupboard <b>would project beyond</b> the <b>four cubits</b> that constitute one’s Shabbat residence.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What,</b> exactly, <b>are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the cupboard <b>has a window, and</b> one has <b>a rope</b> at hand, <b>let him bring it by means of the window and rope.</b> In other words, let him lower the rope through the cupboard’s window and bring the <i>eiruv</i> with it, and he will not have to move the entire cupboard. The Gemara answers: Here we are dealing with a case <b>where it does not have a window, and</b> he does not have <b>a rope</b> at hand.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>If one placed</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a pit, even</b> if <b>it is a hundred cubits deep,</b> his <i>eiruv</i> is a valid <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>This pit, where is it situated? If you say that it is situated in the private domain,</b><br><br>Daf 34b<br><br><b>it is obvious,</b> for <b>the private domain ascends to the sky, and just as it ascends upward, so</b> too, <b>it descends downward</b> to the bottom of the pit, even if it is more than ten handbreadths deep. <b>Rather,</b> we must say <b>that</b> the pit <b>is situated in the public domain.</b><br>The Gemara now clarifies: <b>Where</b> did one <b>intend to establish his Shabbat residence? If</b> he intended to establish his residence <b>above</b> the pit in the public domain, this is a case where <b>he is in one place and his <i>eiruv</i> is in another place,</b> i.e., in a private domain, and therefore his <i>eiruv</i> is not valid. Alternatively, <b>if</b> one intended to establish his Shabbat residence <b>below,</b> in the pit, <b>it is</b> also <b>obvious,</b> as <b>he and his <i>eiruv</i> are in one place.</b><br>The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is necessary only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the pit <b>is situated in a <i>karmelit</i>, and he intended to establish his Shabbat residence above</b> the pit in the <i>karmelit</i>. <b>And</b> with regard to the question of how this <i>eiruv</i> can be valid, as one cannot bring the <i>eiruv</i> from the pit to the <i>karmelit</i>, the answer is that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said:</b> With regard to <b>anything that is</b> prohibited on Shabbat <b>due to rabbinic decree [<i>shevut</i>], they did not issue the decree</b> to apply <b>during twilight.</b> Since carrying from the pit to the <i>karmelit</i> is only prohibited as a <i>shevut</i>, a person may carry from the pit to the <i>karmelit</i> during twilight, the time when the <i>eiruv</i> establishes one’s Shabbat residence.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> <b>on top of a reed or on top of a pole [<i>kundas</i>], when</b> the reed or pole <b>is detached</b> from its original place <b>and stuck</b> into the ground, <b>even</b> if it is <b>a hundred cubits high, it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> as one can remove the reed or pole from the ground and take his <i>eiruv</i>.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana raised a contradiction before Rava</b> concerning two tannaitic rulings: The mishna states that if the reed <b>was detached</b> from its place of growth <b>and</b> then <b>stuck</b> into the ground, <b>yes,</b> the <i>eiruv</i> is valid. That indicates that if it <b>was not detached and</b> then <b>stuck</b> back into the ground, <b>no,</b> the <i>eiruv</i> is not valid. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: Anything that is</b> prohibited on Shabbat <b>due to rabbinic decree [<i>shevut</i>],</b> such as using a tree on Shabbat, <b>they issued the decree</b> to apply even <b>during twilight.</b> Therefore, if the <i>eiruv</i> was on top of a reed that was still attached to the ground in its original place of growth, since it is prohibited by rabbinic decree to make use of trees on Shabbat, one cannot remove the <i>eiruv</i> from its place at the time that he must establish his Shabbat residence, and therefore his <i>eiruv</i> is invalid. But <b>didn’t you say</b> that <b>the first clause,</b> i.e., the previous mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? How can you say that <b>the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b><br>Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Adda: <b>Rami bar Ḥama already raised this contradiction before Rav Ḥisda, and</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>answered him:</b> Indeed, <b>the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.<br><b>Ravina said:</b> You can, in fact, say that <b>it is all Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and the latter clause,</b> i.e., the mishna that insists that the reed be detached and inserted, is not based upon the prohibition of utilizing trees on Shabbat. Rather, in that case there is a unique <b>decree lest he break</b> it <b>off</b> from the ground if the reed is relatively soft. Therefore, the mishna requires one to use something that has already been detached from the ground and reinserted. However, the previous mishna is referring to someone who placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a tree, where this concern is not relevant.<br>The Gemara relates <b>that</b> a certain <b>army [<i>pulmosa</i>]</b> once <b>came to Neharde’a</b> and took quarters in the study hall, so that there was not enough room for the students. <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the students: <b>Go out and create</b> seats by <b>compressing</b> reeds <b>in the marshes, and tomorrow,</b> on Shabbat, <b>we will go and sit on them</b> and study there.<br><b>Rami bar Ḥama raised an objection to Rav Naḥman, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Ukva bar Abba</b> who raised the objection <b>to Rav Naḥman,</b> from the mishna that states that if the reed <b>was detached and</b> then <b>stuck</b> into the ground, <b>yes;</b> but if it <b>was not detached and not stuck</b> into the ground, <b>no.</b> This shows that it is not enough to compress the reeds, and they must actually be detached from the ground before they may be used on Shabbat.<br>Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: There,</b> in the mishna, we are dealing with <b>hard</b> reeds, which may not be bent and used on Shabbat, unlike soft reeds. He adds: <b>And from where do you say that we distinguish between hard</b> reeds <b>and</b> reeds <b>that are not hard? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Reeds, boxthorn, and thistles are species of trees, and</b> therefore they <b>are not</b> included in the prohibition of <b>food crops in a vineyard,</b> which applies only to herbs planted among vines. <b>And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Reeds, cassia, and bulrushes are species of herbs, and</b> therefore <b>they are</b> included in the prohibition of <b>food crops in a vineyard.</b> These two <i>baraitot</i> <b>contradict one another,</b> as one states that reeds are trees, while the other says that they are considered herbs.<br><b>Rather, conclude from this</b> that we must distinguish between them as follows: <b>Here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring <b>to hard</b> reeds, which are like trees; whereas <b>there,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is referring <b>to</b> reeds <b>that are not hard.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that our resolution of the contradiction is correct.<br>The Gemara raises a question with regard to the previously cited <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is cassia a type of herb? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>One may not graft rue to white cassia, as this</b> involves the grafting of <b>herbs to a tree?</b> This proves that white cassia is a tree. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> There is no difficulty, as <b>cassia is distinct</b> and is considered a type of herb, <b>and white cassia is distinct</b> and is considered a type of tree.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>If one put</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a cupboard</b> and locked it, <b>and the key was lost,</b> so that he is now unable to open the cupboard and access the <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it is</b> nonetheless a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>. Rabbi Eliezer says: If he does not know that the key is in its place, it is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> should the <i>eiruv</i> be valid if the key was lost? <b>He is in one place and his <i>eiruv</i> is in a different place,</b> since he cannot access the <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>It was Rav and Shmuel who both said: Here, we are dealing with a cupboard</b> made <b>of bricks, and</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: One may create a breach</b> in a brick wall on Shabbat <b><i>ab initio</i>, and take</b> produce from the other side. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If <b>a house filled with produce</b> had been <b>sealed and was</b> then <b>breached, one may take out</b> produce <b>from the place of the breach. Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says: One may</b> even <b>create a breach</b> in the wall of the house <b>and take</b> produce <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Consequently, according to Rabbi Meir it is permissible to make a hole in the cupboard in order to remove the produce found inside.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rav Naḥman bar Adda say that Shmuel said</b> that that very mishna cited as a proof is referring <b>to</b> a structure built from <b>layers of bricks</b> piled one atop the other without cement or mortar between them, in which case making a hole cannot be considered dismantling a bona fide structure? The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> we are dealing with a cupboard made from <b>layers of bricks.</b><br>The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Zeira say:</b> The Sages in the aforementioned mishna, who discussed the breaching of a wall, <b>spoke</b> only <b>with regard to a Festival, but not with regard to Shabbat?</b> Therefore, it cannot be derived from that mishna that it is permitted to breach the cupboard on Shabbat in order to access the food inside. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case where the person needed an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>a Festival</b> but not for Shabbat.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the mishna is referring only to a Festival, there is a difficulty with <b>that which was taught about it</b> in the following <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If</b> the key <b>was lost in a city, his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>; and if it was lost in a field, his <i>eiruv</i> is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> for within a city it is possible to carry the key by way of courtyards that have joined together in an <i>eiruv</i> or the like, but in a field it is impossible to carry it, as the field has the status of a <i>karmelit</i>. <b>And if</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a Festival, what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether the key was lost in a <b>city</b> or a <b>field?</b> On a Festival there is no prohibition against carrying from a private to a public domain, and therefore if the key was lost even in a field, the <i>eiruv</i> should still be valid.<br><br></body></html>
