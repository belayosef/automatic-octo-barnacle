Daf 58a<br><br><b>provided he does not</b> thereby <b>go out beyond the</b> city’s Shabbat <b>limit,</b> as those watching the surveyor might mistakenly think the limit extends to that point.<br><b>If,</b> due to the width of the canyon or hill, <b>he cannot span it, with regard to this</b> situation <b>Rabbi Dostai bar Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Meir: I heard that one may pierce hills.</b> In other words, one measures the distance as if there were a hole from one side of the hill to the other, so that in effect, he measures only the horizontal distance and ignores the differences in elevation.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the Shabbat limit must be measured with a rope fifty cubits long, derived? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> They are derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>The Torah states: Measure with a rope of fifty cubits,</b> i.e., the length and breadth of the courtyard must be measured “by fifty,” with a rope fifty cubits long.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> repetitive usage of the word fifty <b>is necessary</b> to teach us something else, namely, that the area of a courtyard is equivalent to a square the size of the Tabernacle’s courtyard. To this end, the Torah states: <b>Take</b> a square of <b>fifty</b> cubits by fifty cubits, <b>and surround</b> it with the remaining <b>fifty</b> cubits in order to form a square, each side of which is just over seventy cubits long.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse state: Fifty, fifty,</b> which would have sufficed to teach us the size and shape of a courtyard. <b>What is</b> the significance of the phrase: <b>Fifty by fifty? Conclude from this</b> that the verse comes to teach <b>two</b> things, both the matter of the square courtyard and that the length of the rope used to measure the Shabbat limit should be fifty cubits long.<br>We learned in the mishna: One may measure a Shabbat limit only with a rope fifty cubits long, <b>not less and not more. It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>No less, because</b> a shorter rope improperly <b>increases</b> the Shabbat limit, as the rope is likely to be stretched. <b>And no more, because</b> a longer rope <b>reduces</b> the limit, as the rope is likely to sag due to its weight.<br><b>Rabbi Asi said: One may measure only with a rope of <i>afsakima</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>afsakima</i>? Rabbi Abba said:</b> It is the <b><i>nargila</i></b> plant. This name was also not widely known, and therefore the Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>nargila</i>? Rabbi Ya’akov said: A palm tree</b> that has only <b>one fibrous vine</b> wrapped around it. <b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion, according to which the Gemara asked: <b>What is <i>afsakima</i>? Rabbi Abba said:</b> It is the <b><i>nargila</i></b> plant. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> It is <b>a palm tree</b> with <b>one fibrous vine.</b><br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said: You have nothing better for measuring than iron chains,</b> as they do not stretch. <b>But what shall we do, as the Torah states:</b> “I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man <b>with a measuring rope in his hand”</b> (Zechariah 2:5), from which it is derived that measurements must be made with a rope.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “And in the man’s hand a measuring reed</b> of six cubits long, of one cubit and a handbreadth each” (Ezekiel 40:5), which indicates that reeds may also be used for measuring? The Gemara answers: <b>That is</b> used <b>for</b> measuring <b>gates,</b> which are too narrow to be measured with lengthy ropes.<br><b>Rav Yosef taught</b> that <b>there are three</b> kinds of <b>rope,</b> each required by <i>halakha</i> for a different purpose: A rope <b>of <i>magag</i>,</b> a kind of bulrush reed; a rope <b>of <i>netzer</i>,</b> made from fibrous palm vines; <b>and</b> a rope <b>of flax.</b><br>They are used for the following purposes: A rope <b>of <i>magag</i></b> is utilized <b>for</b> the burning of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>They would bind</b> the heifer <b>with a rope of <i>magag</i> and place it on its woodpile,</b> where it would be burned after it was slaughtered. A rope <b>of <i>netzer</i></b> was required <b>for a <i>sota</i>,</b> a woman suspected of adultery, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: Before the <i>sota</i> is compelled to drink the bitter waters, her clothes are torn. <b>And after that</b> a priest <b>brings a <i>mitzri</i> rope,</b> i.e., a rope made of reeds [<i>netzarim</i>], <b>and binds it above her breasts,</b> so that her garments will not fall. A rope <b>of flax</b> is used <b>for measuring.</b><br>It was stated in the mishna: If <b>he was measuring</b> the limit <b>and he reached</b> a canyon or a fence, he spans the area as if it were completely flat and then resumes his measurement. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>it taught</b> that <b>he resumes his measurement,</b> it may be derived <b>by inference that if he cannot span it</b> because it is too wide, <b>he goes to a place where</b> it is narrower so that <b>he can span it. And he spans it, and he</b> then <b>looks</b> for the spot at the same distance that is <b>aligned with his</b> original <b>measurement, and he resumes</b> his measurement from there.<br>The Gemara comments that <b>we have</b> indeed <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who was measuring</b> the Shabbat limit <b>and the measurement reached a canyon, if he can span</b> the canyon <b>with a rope of fifty cubits,</b> i.e., if the canyon is less than fifty cubits wide, <b>he spans it. And if not,</b> i.e., if the valley is more than fifty cubits wide, <b>he goes to a place where</b> it is narrower so that <b>he can span it, and he spans it, and he</b> then <b>looks</b> for the spot at the same distance that aligns with his original measurement, <b>and he resumes his measurement</b> from there.<br>The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If the canyon was curved</b> so that it surrounds the city on more than one side, and it cannot be spanned on the side where he wishes to measure the limit, <b>he pierces and ascends, pierces and descends,</b> thereby measuring the canyon’s width bit by bit. If <b>he reached a wall, we do not say that he should pierce the wall</b> so that it can be precisely measured; <b>rather, he estimates</b> its width <b>and</b> then <b>leaves</b> and continues on.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If he reached a canyon or fence, <b>he spans it and</b> then <b>resumes his measurement?</b> Why is a precise measurement required there, whereas in the case of a wall, an estimate is sufficient? The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the mishna, we are dealing with a place whose <b>use is convenient,</b> i.e., where the slope is relatively gentle so that the area can be crossed. Therefore, the area must actually be measured. However, <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the wall’s <b>use is not convenient.</b> Since one cannot walk through the wall, an estimate of its width is sufficient.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> the method of piercing <b>only where a plumb line does not drop straight down,</b> i.e., where the canyon has a slope.<br><br>Daf 58b<br><br><b>However,</b> if <b>a plumb line drops straight down,</b> i.e., if the canyon wall is very steep, <b>he measures</b> the width of the canyon <b>properly</b> at the bottom of the canyon, without taking its walls into account.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the depth of a canyon</b> that may be spanned if it is not more than fifty cubits wide? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Up to <b>two thousand</b> cubits; but if it is deeper than that, the slope must be measured as well.<br><b>Abaye raised an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If a canyon is up to <b>one hundred</b> cubits <b>deep and</b> up to <b>fifty</b> cubits <b>wide, one may span it; and if not, one may not span it.</b> How could Rav Yosef say that the canyon may be spanned if its depth is less than two thousand cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>He stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>; as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: Even</b> if the canyon is <b>two thousand</b> cubits <b>deep and fifty</b> cubits <b>wide, one may span it.</b><br>The Gemara cites an alternate version of the previous discussion. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rav Yosef said: Even</b> if the canyon is <b>more than two thousand</b> cubits deep, it may be spanned. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Yosef say this? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, and</b> it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>Aḥerim</i>.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> where the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree about the depth of a canyon that may be spanned, they refer to a case where <b>a plumb line does not drop straight down</b> and therefore there is reason to measure the slope. <b>Here,</b> however, where Rav Yosef says that the canyon may be spanned even if it is more than two thousand cubits deep, he is referring to a case where <b>a plumb line drops straight down.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>And where a plumb line does not drop straight down, how much</b> must it extend from the top of the canyon in order for the wall of the canyon to be considered a slope rather than a vertical wall? <b>Avimi said: Four</b> cubits. If the bed of the canyon lies four cubits beyond the top edge of the canyon, the wall is sloped and must be included in the measurement. <b>And similarly, Rami bar Ezekiel taught,</b> based upon a <i>baraita</i>, that the maximum run is <b>four</b> cubits.<br>We learned in the mishna: If <b>he reached a hill,</b> he does not measure its height, but rather <b>he spans</b> the hill as if it were not there <b>and</b> then <b>resumes his measurement. Rava said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to a hill that has an incline of ten</b> handbreadths <b>within</b> a run of <b>four</b> cubits. <b>However, with regard to</b> a gentler <b>hill,</b> e.g., one <b>that has an incline of ten</b> handbreadths <b>within five</b> cubits, <b>one must measure</b> the hill <b>properly,</b> i.e., he must include the slope itself in his measurement.<br>The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, teaches a lenient</b> formulation of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rava said</b> that <b>they only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a hill that has an incline of ten</b> handbreadths <b>within</b> a run of <b>five</b> cubits. <b>However, with regard to</b> a steeper <b>hill that has an incline of ten</b> handbreadths <b>within four</b> cubits, one need not take any precise measurements; instead, <b>he estimates</b> the length of the hill, <b>and</b> then <b>leaves</b> and continues measuring from the other side.<br>We learned in the mishna that one may measure a canyon or hill located within the Shabbat limit, <b>provided that one does not go out beyond the limit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this restriction? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> It is <b>a decree, lest</b> people <b>say: The measurement of the</b> Shabbat <b>limit comes to here.</b> Since people know that he set out to measure the Shabbat limit, if they see him measuring in a certain spot they will assume that the area is included in the Shabbat limit.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>If,</b> due to the width of the canyon or hill, <b>one cannot span it,</b> he may pierce it. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> which explains this procedure: <b>How does one</b> figuratively <b>pierce</b> a hill? Two people hold the two ends of a measuring rope. The one who is <b>lower</b> down on the hill holds the rope <b>at the level of his heart</b> while the one who is <b>higher</b> holds it <b>at the level of his feet,</b> and they proceed to measure in this fashion. <b>Abaye said:</b> Based on tradition, <b>we hold</b> that <b>one may pierce only with a rope of four cubits.</b><br><b>Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> Based on tradition, <b>we hold</b> that <b>one may not pierce</b> when measuring distances for the rite of the <b>beheaded heifer.</b> This rite is practiced when a murder victim is found, and it is not known who killed him. Judges measure the distance from the location of the corpse to the nearest town, in order to determine which town must perform the rite (Deuteronomy 21). Similarly, <b>one may not</b> pierce when measuring distances with regard to <b>cities of refuge,</b> in order to determine the boundaries within which an accidental murderer is protected from the blood redeemer (Numbers 32). <b>Because</b> these measurements <b>are from the Torah,</b> indirect methods of measurement are insufficient. The area must be measured as though it were flat.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>may measure</b> the Shabbat limit <b>only with an expert</b> surveyor. If it is discovered that the surveyor <b>extended</b> the limit <b>in one place and reduced it in another place,</b> so that the line marking the Shabbat limit is not straight, <b>one accepts</b> the measurement of <b>the place where he extended</b> the limit and straightens the limit accordingly. Similarly, if the surveyor <b>extended</b> the limit <b>for one and reduced</b> it <b>for another, one accepts the extended</b> measurement.<br><b>And</b> furthermore, <b>even</b> a gentile <b>slave</b> and <b>even</b> a gentile <b>maidservant,</b> whose testimonies are generally considered unreliable, <b>are trustworthy to say: The Shabbat limit</b> extended <b>until here; as the Sages did not state the matter,</b> the laws of Shabbat limits, <b>to be stringent, but</b> rather <b>to be lenient.</b> The prohibition to walk more than two thousand cubits is rabbinic in origin and is therefore interpreted leniently.<br><br></body></html>
