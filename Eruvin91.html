Daf 91a<br><br>Similarly, <b>enclosures are a domain in and of themselves,</b> and one is therefore permitted to carry from one enclosure to another. <b>According to the statement of the Rabbis, roofs and courtyards</b> constitute <b>one domain,</b> and therefore, one may carry even from a roof to a courtyard; however, <b>enclosures are one</b> discrete <b>domain. According to the statement of Rabbi Shimon, all of them,</b> roofs, courtyards, and enclosures, <b>are one domain,</b> and therefore it is permitted to carry between any of them.<br>The Gemara comments: A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> and a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda.</b> The Gemara elaborates. A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> that according to the Rabbis one may carry only four cubits on each roof: <b>All the roofs of a city are one domain, and it is prohibited to carry</b> objects <b>up or carry</b> them <b>down, from the roofs to the courtyard or from the courtyard to the roofs. And</b> with regard to <b>vessels that were inside a courtyard</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began, <b>it is permitted to carry them in the courtyard</b> even if an <i>eiruv</i> was not established, and it is likewise permitted to carry them from that courtyard to other courtyards. With regard to vessels that were <b>on the roofs</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began, <b>it is permitted to carry them on the roofs, provided that one roof is neither ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher nor ten</b> handbreadths <b>lower</b> than the other. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Each and every one of</b> the roofs <b>is a domain in and of itself, and one may move</b> objects <b>on</b> each roof <b>only within four</b> cubits.<br>Likewise, a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with Rav Yehuda’s</b> interpretation of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Shimon in Tekoa, we would carry oil</b> for smearing <b>and a towel</b> for drying <b>from roof to roof, and from roof to courtyard, and from courtyard to courtyard, and from courtyard to enclosure, and from enclosure to enclosure,</b> to refrain from carrying in a prohibited place, <b>until we reached the spring in which we would bathe.</b><br>And similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident during a time of danger,</b> when decrees were issued that banned religious observance, <b>and we would carry a Torah scroll from courtyard to roof, and from roof to courtyard, and from courtyard to enclosure, to read from it.</b><br>The Sages <b>said to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> cannot be determined from that incident, as an incident occurring during <b>a time of danger is no proof.</b> At a time of danger it is permitted to carry even in places where carrying is ordinarily prohibited by rabbinic law.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs,</b> courtyards, and enclosures are <b>all</b> one domain with regard to vessels that were inside them when Shabbat began, and one may therefore carry from one of these areas to the other. However, they are not one domain with regard to vessels that were inside the house when Shabbat began.<br><b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, provided that</b> the residents of each courtyard <b>did not establish a</b> separate <b><i>eiruv</i></b> for themselves, as in that case they may not move objects from their houses into the courtyard. <b>However, if they established</b> a separate <b><i>eiruv</i></b> for each courtyard, without establishing an <i>eiruv</i> between the various courtyards, <b>no,</b> that is not the <i>halakha</i>, <b>as we issue a decree lest one come to take out vessels</b> from one <b>of</b> the <b>houses to the courtyard,</b> an action that is fundamentally permitted, and subsequently proceed to carry them out to a different courtyard with which an <i>eiruv</i> had not been established, which everyone agrees is prohibited.<br><b>And Shmuel said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon, <b>whether they established an <i>eiruv</i> or whether they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>. And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who whispered to you,</b> who told you that there is a difference <b>whether they established an <i>eiruv</i> or whether they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>?</b><br><b>Rav Ḥisda strongly objects to this</b> ruling. <b>According to Shmuel and according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> people <b>will say</b> with regard to <b>two vessels</b> located <b>in the same courtyard,</b> one of which was in the courtyard when Shabbat began while the other was in the house, that moving <b>this</b> one, which was in the courtyard at the start of Shabbat, to another courtyard is <b>permitted, while</b> moving <b>that one,</b> which was in the house at the start of Shabbat, to another courtyard, is <b>prohibited.</b><br>The Gemara answers: In this regard, <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard <b>reasoning, as he did not issue a decree</b> due to these concerns. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna, <b>Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to three courtyards that are open into each other, and that are</b> also <b>open into a public domain.</b> If <b>the two outer</b> courtyards each <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with the middle one,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for the residents of the middle one to carry <b>into</b> the two outer ones, <b>and they,</b> the residents of the two outer ones, <b>are permitted</b> to carry <b>into it, but</b> for the residents of <b>the two outer</b> courtyards it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry <b>into each other,</b> as they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> together.<br><b>And</b> in that case Rabbi Shimon <b>did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting one to carry objects from the middle courtyard to one of the outer ones <b>lest one come to take out vessels from this</b> outer <b>courtyard to that</b> outer <b>courtyard,</b> despite the fact that both sets of vessels are located in the middle courtyard. <b>Here too, we do not issue a decree lest one come to take out utensils</b> from one <b>of the houses to the courtyard,</b> and carry them to a different courtyard.<br><b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection.</b> We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs, courtyards, and enclosures are all one domain with regard to vessels that were inside them</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began. <b>But</b> they are <b>not</b> one domain <b>with regard to vessels that were inside the house</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that it is dealing with a case where the residents of the courtyards <b>established an <i>eiruv</i>, that is how you find vessels</b> that were taken <b>from the house in the courtyard.</b> Because those vessels were in the house at the beginning of Shabbat, they may not be moved to a different courtyard.<br><b>However, if you say</b> it is referring to a case <b>where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> under <b>what</b> circumstances can the case of <b>vessels from the house in the courtyard</b> be found? This poses a difficulty for Rav. Rav Sheshet <b>raised the objection, and he resolved it:</b> It refers <b>to</b> the case of <b>a hat or a shawl,</b> which one wore in the house and subsequently went out to the courtyard and placed it there. In this manner, it is possible that objects taken from the house can be found in the courtyard, even if an <i>eiruv</i> was not established.<br><br>Daf 91b<br><br><b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the residents of</b> houses that open directly into <b>a courtyard and the residents of</b> upper stories that open onto <b>a balcony</b> from which stairs lead down to that courtyard, <b>who forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> between them, <b>anything ten handbreadths high</b> in the courtyard, e.g., a mound or a pillar, is attributed <b>to the balcony</b> in terms of its use on Shabbat. The residents of the balcony may move objects between the mound or pillar and their apartments. Anything <b>lower than that</b> is attributed <b>to the courtyard. In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that it is prohibited for the residents of the courtyard to carry to the balcony and vice versa, <b>stated?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> the residents of the courtyard <b>were many, and</b> the residents of the balcony were <b>many, and these established an <i>eiruv</i> for themselves, and those established an <i>eiruv</i> for themselves; or</b> if the courtyard and the balcony were occupied by <b>individuals who need not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for themselves.<br><b>However,</b> if the residents of the courtyard and the balcony <b>were many, and they forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for their courtyard or balcony, in that case <b>roof, and courtyard, and portico, and balcony are all one domain,</b> and it is permitted to carry from one to another any vessels that were located in any one of them when Shabbat began.<br>The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that carrying between them is permitted is <b>that they did not</b> each <b>establish</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> however, if <b>they</b> each <b>established</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>, no,</b> it is prohibited to carry between them. This inference supports Rav and poses a difficulty for Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>Whose</b> opinion is represented by <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that roofs and courtyards form a single domain, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. The Rabbis indeed issued a decree that carrying is prohibited if each group established a separate <i>eiruv</i>.<br>The Gemara comments: The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it is not teaching</b> the cases of <b>an enclosure and an alleyway,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, but only the cases of a roof and a courtyard, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the correct understanding.<br><b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>five courtyards that are open to each other and are</b> also <b>open to an alleyway, and</b> the residents of <b>all</b> the courtyards <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, it is prohibited to carry in or carry out, from a courtyard to the alleyway or from the alleyway to a courtyard. And</b> with regard to <b>vessels that were in the courtyard</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began, <b>it is permitted to carry them in the courtyard, but in the alleyway it is prohibited</b> to carry them.<br><b>And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> doing so, <b>as Rabbi Shimon would say: Whenever</b> the courtyards <b>are</b> in the possession <b>of many</b> people, <b>and they forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> the <b>roof, and courtyard, and portico, and balcony, and enclosure, and alleyway are all one domain.</b> These areas are all classified as private domains, and therefore, it is permitted to carry from one to the other.<br>The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that carrying between them is permitted is <b>that they did not</b> each <b>establish</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> however, if <b>they</b> each <b>established</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>, no,</b> it is prohibited to carry between them. This inference supports Rav and poses a difficulty for Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>They did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>?</b> It means that the residents of the <b>courtyards did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with each other; however, the</b> residents of each <b>courtyard established an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the residents of <b>the houses</b> inside it, and it is nevertheless permitted to carry between them, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>state: They did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> indicating that they did not establish any <i>eiruv</i> at all, either with the residents of the other courtyard or within each courtyard? The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>They did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>?</b> It means that <b>they did not merge</b> the courtyards facing the alleyway.<br><b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Rabbi Shimon is speaking to the Rabbis in accordance with their</b> own <b>opinion,</b> not enumerating the leniencies inherent in his own ruling. His statement should therefore be understood as follows: <b>According to my own</b> opinion, <b>there is no difference</b> if <b>they established an <i>eiruv</i> and there is no difference</b> if <b>they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>. However, according to your</b> opinion, <b>agree with me at least that</b> in a case <b>where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> it is</b> all considered <b>one domain.</b><br><b>And the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> although we agree with you in the cases of a roof, courtyard, portico, and balcony, in the cases of an enclosure and an alleyway we disagree, as <b>they are two domains</b> and therefore it is prohibited to carry from one to the other.<br><b>The Master said</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: Vessels that were in a courtyard at the start of Shabbat may be carried within the courtyard, <b>but in the alleyway it is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that this <b>supports that</b> which <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said, as Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In <b>an alleyway in which they did not merge</b> the courtyards facing it, <b>one may carry only within four cubits.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion. <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>But to an alleyway it is prohibited,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to carry from the courtyard to the alleyway; however, within the alleyway itself it is permitted to carry.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty. If so, <b>that is</b> identical to <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>. The <i>tanna</i> would not have taught the very same thing twice. The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> apparently <b>superfluous teaching was necessary, lest you say: When the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon, it is only</b> in a case <b>where they established an <i>eiruv</i>, but</b> in a case <b>where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> the Rabbis <b>concede to</b> Rabbi Meir that it is all considered one domain and carrying is permitted. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon in both cases, as they prohibit carrying in the alleyway even if the residents did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b><br><br></body></html>
