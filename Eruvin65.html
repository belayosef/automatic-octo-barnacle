Daf 65a<br><br><b>I can</b> make an argument that <b>exempts the entire world from judgment, from the day that the Temple was destroyed until now. As it is stated: “Therefore, hear now this, you afflicted and drunken, but not from wine”</b> (Isaiah 51:21), which teaches that in the wake of the destruction of the Temple, all Jews are considered intoxicated and are not responsible for any sins they commit.<br>The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this argument from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who is <b>intoxicated, his acquisition is a</b> binding <b>acquisition;</b> that is, he cannot retract the transaction when he is sober, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>his sale is a</b> binding <b>sale.</b> Moreover, <b>if he committed a transgression for which</b> he is liable to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>he is executed;</b> and if the offense is punishable by <b>lashes, he is flogged. The principle is</b> that <b>he is like a sober person in all matters, except that he is exempt from prayer.</b> Therefore, even if the people of Israel are considered drunk, they are nonetheless responsible for their actions.<br>The Gemara answers that even Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya did not mean that they should be exempt from liability for all their sins. Rather, <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>his statement: I can exempt?</b> He, <b>too,</b> meant that he could exempt them <b>from the judgment of prayer,</b> i.e., Jews cannot be held liable for praying without the proper intentions.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: They taught</b> that an intoxicated person is responsible for all his actions <b>only</b> in a case where <b>he did not reach the</b> state of <b>intoxication of Lot; however, if he reached the</b> state of <b>intoxication of Lot,</b> so that he is altogether unaware of his actions, <b>he is exempt from all</b> liability.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever passes a shield</b> over himself <b>at a time of arrogance,</b> i.e., whoever suppresses his evil inclination as though it were covered with a shield when he is arrogant, e.g., when he is intoxicated or the like (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <b>troubles will be closed and sealed from him, as it is stated: “The channels of [<i>afikei</i>] his scales are his pride, closed together as with a tight [<i>tzar</i>] seal”</b> (Job 41:7). The verse is interpreted homiletically: When at a time of arrogance a person passes a shield [<i>mapik</i>] over his evil inclination, his troubles [<i>tzarot</i>] will be closed and sealed before him.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>From where may it be inferred that</b> the meaning of <b>this</b> word <b><i>afik</i> is a formulation</b> denoting <b>passing [<i>aborei</i>]?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a wadi, like the channel [<i>afik</i>] of brooks that pass by [<i>ya’avoru</i>]”</b> (Job 6:15). This implies that the term <i>afik</i> is synonymous with the verb <i>ya’avoru</i>, which refers to something that travels and passes by.<br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is not the correct interpretation; rather, <b>it was stated</b> that <b>whoever does not</b> cover, but <b>draws out [<i>mapik</i>]</b> a shield at a time of arrogance, troubles will be closed and sealed from him. In other words, a person must draw his weapons and shield in order to fight his evil inclination when it tries to overpower him (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>From where may it be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>mapik</i> is a formulation</b> denoting <b>revealing?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “The channels of [<i>afikei</i>] waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare”</b> (Psalms 18:16).<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Now, since the verses may be interpreted both in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of</b> this <b>Master and in accordance with</b> the opinion of the other <b>Master, what is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to the following practice of <b>Rav Sheshet, as Rav Sheshet gave</b> the responsibility for monitoring <b>his sleep to his attendant,</b> instructing the attendant to wake him when the time for prayer arrived. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the practice of <b>Rav Sheshet</b> is correct, as Rabbi Ḥanina maintains that if one is in great need of sleep, it is better to nap for a while and then wake up with renewed vigor. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the practice of <b>Rav Sheshet</b> is correct. He holds that a person must marshal his strength and pray, rather than succumb to the need for sleep.<br><b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone whose mind is unsettled should not pray, as it is stated: When distressed, one should not issue decisions.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, on a day that he was angry,</b> would <b>not pray,</b> as <b>he said that it is written: When distressed, one should not issue decisions.</b> The Gemara similarly relates that <b>Mar Ukva, on a day of a south wind, would not venture out to the court,</b> for this hot and harsh wind would disturb his usual clarity of mind.<br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The study of <b><i>halakha</i> requires clarity, as</b> on <b>a day</b> when <b>a north wind</b> blows and clears the skies. <b>Abaye said</b> similarly that <b>if my stepmother says to me: Bring</b> me a dish of <b><i>kutaḥ</i>, I can no</b> longer <b>study</b> Torah in my usual fashion, as even a simple task such as this troubles me and distracts me from my Torah study.<br>Similarly, <b>Rava said: If I am bitten by a louse, I can no</b> longer <b>learn</b> in my usual manner. The Gemara relates that <b>the mother of Mar, son of Ravina, would prepare seven garments for him for the seven days</b> of the week, so that he would not be bitten by the lice found in old clothes (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).<br><b>Rav Yehuda said: Night was created only for sleep. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The moon was created only for</b> Torah <b>study</b> by its light. When people <b>said to Rabbi Zeira: Your teachings are</b> exceedingly <b>sharp, he said to them: They were</b> formulated <b>during the daytime</b> hours. This teaches that Torah study during the day is most beneficial to clarity of the mind.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda’s daughter said to</b> her father, <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who would spend his nights in study: <b>Doesn’t the Master wish to sleep a little?</b> He <b>said to her: Days that are long</b> in quantity <b>but short</b> in the opportunity to study Torah and perform mitzvot <b>will soon arrive, and we will sleep a lot.</b> After I die, there will be more than enough time for sleep.<br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We,</b> Torah scholars, <b>are day workers,</b> as our study is performed primarily during the day. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> would <b>borrow and repay,</b> i.e., if for some reason he neglected to study during the day, he would use the night hours to compensate for the missed time.<br><b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who returns</b> home <b>from a journey should not pray for three days</b> while recovering from the hardship of being on the road, <b>as it is stated: “And I gathered them together at the river that runs to Aḥava, and we encamped there for three days, and I inspected the people”</b> (Ezra 8:15), after which it is stated: “Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Aḥava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a safe journey for us” (Ezra 8:21), which teaches that they rested three days before praying.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel’s father, when he would return</b> home <b>from his journey, would not pray</b> for <b>three days,</b> as he would have to rest from his journey. <b>Shmuel</b> himself <b>would not pray in a house that contained an alcoholic beverage,</b> as the scent of the alcohol would disturb his concentration during prayer. Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa would not pray in a house that contained small</b> fried <b>fish,</b> due to their smell.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever is appeased by his wine,</b> i.e., whoever becomes more relaxed after drinking, <b>has in him</b> an element of <b>the mind-set of his Creator,</b> who acted in a similar fashion, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord smelled the sweet savor,</b> and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake” (Genesis 8:21). As it were, God acted more favorably toward His creatures after He was appeased with the smell of the burnt offerings. Smell can be as potent as drinking or eating itself.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Anyone who remains settled</b> of mind <b>after</b> drinking <b>wine,</b> and does not become intoxicated, <b>has</b> an element of <b>the mind-set of seventy Elders.</b> The allusion is: <b>Wine [<i>yayin</i></b> spelled <i>yod</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>] <b>was given in seventy letters,</b> as the numerological value of the letters comprising the word is seventy, as <i>yod</i> equals ten and <i>nun</i> equals fifty. Similarly, the word <b>secret [<i>sod</i></b> spelled <i>samekh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>dalet</i>] <b>was given in seventy letters,</b> as <i>samekh</i> equals sixty, <i>vav</i> equals six, and <i>dalet</i> equals four. Typically, when <b>wine entered</b> the body, <b>a secret emerged.</b> Whoever does not reveal secrets when he drinks is clearly blessed with a firm mind, like that of seventy Elders.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: Wine was created only in order to comfort mourners</b> in their distress, <b>and to reward the wicked</b> in this world so they will have no reward left in the World-to-Come, <b>as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish,</b> and wine to the bitter of soul. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more” (Proverbs 31:6). “Him that is ready to perish” refers to the wicked, who will perish from the world, while “the bitter of soul” denotes mourners.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥanin bar Pappa said: Anyone in whose house wine does not flow like water is not</b> yet <b>included</b> in the Torah’s <b>blessing, as it is stated: “And He shall bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25). The water mentioned in this verse actually refers to wine, as learned in the following manner: <b>Just as bread</b> is something <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> i.e., one is permitted to buy bread with money used to redeem second-tithe, <b>so</b> too the word <b>water</b> in the verse is referring to a liquid <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money. And what is that?</b> It is <b>wine,</b> as one may buy wine with second-tithe money, but one may not buy water; <b>and</b> nevertheless, the verse <b>calls it “water.”</b><br><br>Daf 65b<br><br>This teaches that <b>if</b> wine <b>flows in</b> a person’s <b>house like water, there is a blessing, but if not,</b> there is <b>no</b> blessing.<br><b>Rabbi Elai said: In three matters a person’s</b> true character is <b>ascertained; in his cup,</b> i.e., his behavior when he drinks; <b>in his pocket,</b> i.e., his conduct in his financial dealings with other people; <b>and in his anger. And some say:</b> A person <b>also</b> reveals his real nature <b>in his laughter.</b><br>The Gemara returns to the topic of <i>eiruvin</i>: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It once happened that there were two courtyards, one within the other, with <b>a Jew and a gentile</b> living in the <b>inner</b> courtyard, <b>while</b> a single <b>Jew</b> lived <b>in the outer one.</b> The <b>case came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi for a decision as to whether carrying in the outer courtyard could be permitted without renting from the gentile, <b>and he prohibited</b> it. The case then came before <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, and he</b> too <b>prohibited</b> it.<br><b>Rabba and Rav Yosef were sitting at the end of Rav Sheshet’s lecture, and Rav Sheshet sat and said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did Rav say</b> this <b>ruling of his,</b> with regard to the residents of two courtyards? It was <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that a gentile renders it prohibited for even a single Jew who resides with him to carry in the courtyard, and therefore it is necessary for the Jew to rent from him. <b>Rabba nodded his head</b> in agreement with this explanation.<br><b>Rav Yosef said: Would two great men like</b> these <b>Sages,</b> Rabba and Rav Sheshet, <b>err in such a matter? If</b> this ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, why do I</b> need to state that there is <b>a Jew in the outer</b> courtyard? According to Rabbi Meir, even a single Jew who resides with a gentile may not carry in his courtyard, whether or not another Jew is present.<br><b>And</b> even <b>if you say</b> that indeed this is the <i>halakha</i>, that the Jew in the outer courtyard is of no consequence, and that he is only mentioned because <b>the incident that took place, took place in this way,</b> and those who came to ask the question provided all the details without knowing whether they were relevant, this is still difficult. <b>Wasn’t a dilemma raised before Rav</b> himself with regard to this very issue: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing a Jew living in <b>the inner</b> courtyard <b>with regard to his</b> own <b>place?</b> Can he carry in the inner courtyard? <b>And he said to them: It is permitted</b> for him to carry there. Therefore, according to Rav, a gentile does not render it prohibited for a single Jew to carry, which is actually contrary to Rabbi Meir’s opinion.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Rather, what</b> else can you say? Can you say that he ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? Didn’t</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>say:</b> The gentile does not render it prohibited to carry <b>unless there are two Jews</b> living in the same courtyard who themselves render it <b>prohibited for one another</b> to carry without an <i>eiruv</i>? In this case they do not render it prohibited for each other to carry without an <i>eiruv</i>, as they do not live in the same courtyard.<br><b>Rather,</b> you might say that he ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said:</b> The <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted in his</b> own <b>place</b> nonetheless <b>renders it prohibited not in its</b> own <b>place.</b> The Jew in the inner courtyard is permitted to carry in his own courtyard. However, in order to leave his courtyard, he passes through the outer one, in which it is prohibited for him to carry. Therefore, he renders it prohibited for the resident of the outer courtyard as well.<br>But if that is the case, the following difficulty arises: According to this opinion, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a gentile</b> in the inner courtyard? <b>The</b> single <b>Jew</b> living in the inner courtyard <b>would also</b> suffice to render it prohibited for the resident of the outer courtyard to carry in his own courtyard, even if no gentiles were present at all.<br><b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> that Rav’s ruling should be understood as follows: <b>Actually,</b> Rav ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> with regard to a gentile, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> with regard to a foot that renders it prohibited to carry. <b>And with what we are dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the two Jews <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> with one another. <b>And the reason</b> that Rav prohibited carrying in the outer courtyard is <b>that there is a gentile who renders it prohibited</b> to carry, <b>but</b> if <b>there is no gentile, it is not prohibited,</b> as the Jews established an <i>eiruv</i> with one another, and therefore they are permitted to carry.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Eliezer raised a dilemma before Rav</b> as follows: If <b>a Jew and a gentile</b> live together <b>in the outer</b> courtyard, <b>and a Jew</b> lives alone <b>in the inner one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May they carry in the outer courtyard without renting from the gentile? One could argue as follows: <b>There,</b> in the case where the Jew and the gentile share the inner courtyard, <b>the reason</b> the Sages prohibited carrying is <b>because it is common</b> for a Jew and a gentile <b>to live</b> together in such a fashion. Ordinarily a single Jew would not live together in the same courtyard as a gentile, for fear that the gentile might kill him. However, here, the Jew living in the inner courtyard believes <b>that</b> the <b>gentile would be afraid</b> to kill him, <b>as</b> the gentile <b>thinks</b> to himself: <b>Now,</b> were I to kill my neighbor, the <b>Jew</b> living in the outer courtyard <b>might come and say to me:</b> The <b>Jew who used to</b> live <b>by you, where is</b> he? The gentile would not be able to offer as an excuse that the Jew left, for the other Jew from outer courtyard would know whether or not he passed through his courtyard. Therefore, since that living arrangement is common, the decree applies, and the gentile’s residence in the courtyard renders it prohibited to carry there.<br><b>However, here,</b> where the gentile lives in the outer courtyard, he is not afraid of killing his Jewish neighbor, as he says to himself: If the other Jew comes to question me, <b>I will say to him: He went out</b> and <b>went</b> on <b>his</b> way; I do not know where he went. In this case, the gentile would not be concerned that the Jew from the inner courtyard might question his story. Since it is uncommon for a Jew and a gentile to live together in such a fashion, the Sages did not issue a decree that the gentile’s residence renders the courtyard prohibited for carrying.<br><b>Or perhaps</b> one would say that <b>here, too,</b> the gentile <b>would be afraid</b> to kill his Jewish neighbor, <b>as he thinks</b> to himself: <b>Now,</b> were I to kill my neighbor, <b>the Jew</b> living in the inner courtyard <b>might come</b> at any moment <b>and see me</b> in the act of killing his friend. Since the gentile does not know when the resident of the inner courtyard will pass through the outer courtyard, there is a chance his crime might be witnessed. In that case, it would not be uncommon for a Jew and a gentile to live together in such a fashion, and the Sages’ decree that the gentile’s residence renders carrying prohibited would apply.<br>Rav <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer the following verse: <b>“Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser”</b> (Proverbs 9:9), i.e., it is proper to be stringent even in such a case. Consequently, carrying is prohibited in the outer courtyard unless the Jews rent from the gentile.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>Reish Lakish and the students of Rabbi Ḥanina happened</b> to come on Shabbat <b>to a certain inn</b> that had at least three permanent residents, two Jews and a gentile who rented their quarters from the gentile innkeeper. Although <b>the</b> gentile <b>tenant was not</b> present on that Shabbat, the gentile <b>landlord was</b> present. Concerned that the gentile tenant might return during Shabbat and render it prohibited for them to carry, Rabbi Ḥanina’s students wondered whether the gentile landlord can rent out the gentile’s room again for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>They said: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to renting from him?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Anywhere that</b> the landlord <b>cannot remove</b> the tenant, <b>you</b> need <b>not raise the dilemma, for they</b> clearly <b>cannot rent</b> it from him. If the landlord is unable to expel the tenant, the residence temporarily belongs completely to the tenant, and only he can rent it out. <b>Where you</b> need to <b>raise the dilemma</b> is with regard to a situation <b>where he can remove him.</b><br><b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>since</b> the landlord <b>can remove</b> the tenant, <b>they can rent</b> the residence from him, as the landlord retains a measure of control over it, and therefore he can rent it out again for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Or perhaps now, in any case he has not</b> actually <b>removed him,</b> which means the residence is still entirely under the tenant’s jurisdiction?<br><b>Reish Lakish said to them: Let us rent</b> it now, as the principle is that one may act leniently in a case of doubt involving a rabbinic prohibition, <b>and when we arrive at our Sages in the South we shall ask them</b> whether we acted properly. Later <b>they came and asked Rabbi Afes,</b> who <b>said to them: You acted well when you rented</b> it from the landlord.<br>The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yosef and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Asi happened</b> to come <b>to a certain inn, and the gentile innkeeper,</b> who was absent when Shabbat began, <b>came on Shabbat. They said: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to renting from him</b> now? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: <b>Is renting</b> from a gentile <b>like making an <i>eiruv</i>?</b> If so, <b>just as one who establishes an <i>eiruv</i></b> may do so only <b>while it is still day, so</b> too, <b>one who rents</b> a gentile’s property must do so <b>while it is still day.</b><br><b>Or perhaps one who rents</b> from a gentile <b>is like one who renounces</b> rights to his <b>domain; just as one who renounces</b> rights to his <b>domain</b> may do so <b>even on Shabbat</b> itself, <b>so</b> too, <b>one who rents</b> a gentile’s property may do so <b>even on Shabbat.</b> In that case, they would be able to rent from the gentile in exchange for something of value, even on Shabbat itself.<br><b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yosef said: Let us rent,</b> while <b>Rabbi Asi said: Let us not rent. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to them: Let us rely</b> now <b>on the words of</b> the <b>Elder,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yosef, <b>and rent.</b> Later <b>they came and asked Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> about the matter, and <b>he said to them:</b><br><br></body></html>
