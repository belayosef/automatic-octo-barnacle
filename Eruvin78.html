Daf 78a<br><br>If <b>a projection four by four</b> handbreadths in area <b>extends from a wall, and one placed a ladder of any</b> width <b>against it,</b> if the rungs of the ladder are less than three handbreadths apart, <b>he has diminished</b> the height of the wall by means of this ladder and projection.<br>The Gemara qualifies this statement: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one placed</b> the ladder directly <b>against</b> the projection, so that the ladder serves as a passage to it. <b>However, if he placed it adjacent to</b> the projection, <b>he has</b> merely <b>widened</b> the projection, while the ladder remains separate from it. Consequently, the projection does not have any connection to the ground, and a projection that is not within three handbreadths of the ground does not diminish the height of a wall.<br><b>And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> If <b>a wall</b> between two courtyards is <b>nineteen</b> handbreadths high, <b>it requires one projection to</b> render the use of the wall <b>permitted.</b> If there is a single projection in the middle of the wall, with a ladder of any width resting against it, it is considered a passageway between the courtyards, as the projection is within ten handbreadths of the top of the wall.<br>However, if <b>the wall</b> is <b>twenty</b> handbreadths high, it <b>requires two projections to</b> render the use of the wall <b>permitted,</b> one within ten handbreadths of the ground, and the other within ten handbreadths of the top of the wall. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: And this</b> applies only <b>where he positioned</b> the projections <b>not</b> directly <b>one above the other,</b> so that it is possible to use a ladder to climb from one projection to the other.<br><b>Rav Huna said:</b> If <b>a pillar in the public domain</b> is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> so that it is considered a private domain, <b>and one drove a stake of any</b> size <b>into</b> the top of <b>it, he has diminished its</b> area. The usable area is now less than four handbreadths, and therefore the pillar is no longer considered a private domain.<br><b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> This applies only if the stake is at least <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>high.</b> If it is less than three handbreadths high, it is considered part of the top of the pillar, based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>. This is in contrast to <b>Abaye and Rava, who both say: Even if</b> the stake is <b>not three</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> the pillar is no longer considered a private domain.<br><b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion of Abaye and Rava? It is that the pillar <b>is no longer</b> fit to be <b>used,</b> as a surface of four by four handbreadths is suitable for use only when it is level. If it has even a small projection, it is no longer usable.<br><b>Rav Ashi said: Even a stake three</b> handbreadths <b>high</b> does not diminish the area of the pillar. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>it is possible to hang an item on it. Although</b> it is no longer possible to rest objects on top of the pillar, it is still useful in some way.<br><b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> According to your opinion, if <b>he filled it entirely with stakes,</b> i.e., if he drove so many stakes into the top of the post that it was completely filled, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?<br>Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Did you not hear that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said?</b> He said that <b>a pit and its embankment</b> of stone around the edge <b>join</b> together to complete the measure of <b>ten</b> handbreadths. Similarly, the width of the embankment joins with the diameter of the pit to complete the measure of four by four handbreadths necessary to define the pit as a private domain.<br>There, too, one can raise the question: <b>But why? He cannot use</b> the embankment, as most of the area is the empty space of the pit. <b>Rather, what have you to say,</b> i.e., how can you solve this problem? The solution is <b>that he places an item,</b> e.g., a board, over the mouth of the pit, <b>and</b> then he can make <b>use</b> of it. <b>Here, too, he places an item</b> over the stakes <b>and</b> can make <b>use</b> of the pillar.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>a wall</b> is <b>ten</b> handbreadths high, <b>it requires a ladder fourteen</b> handbreadths high, so that one can place the ladder at a diagonal against the wall. The ladder then functions as a passageway and thereby renders the use of the wall <b>permitted. Rav Yosef said: Even</b> a ladder with a height of <b>thirteen</b> handbreadths <b>and a bit</b> is enough, as it is sufficient if the ladder reaches within one handbreadth of the top of the wall.<br><b>Abaye said: Even</b> a ladder that is only <b>eleven</b> handbreadths <b>and a bit</b> suffices, as the ladder will still reach a height of over seven handbreadths, i.e., within three handbreadths of the top of the wall.<br><b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Even</b> if the ladder is only <b>seven</b> handbreadths <b>and a bit</b> it is sufficient, as he can stand the ladder upright against the wall. Since it will reach within three handbreadths of the top of the wall, the principle of <i>lavud</i> applies. Therefore, even a ladder placed in this manner is considered a valid passageway between the two courtyards.<br>Similarly, <b>Rav said: An upright ladder</b> effectively <b>diminishes</b> the height of a wall, as it creates a passageway. I received this teaching as <b>a tradition, but I do not know what the reason is,</b> as people do not generally climb ladders positioned in this manner.<br><b>Shmuel said: Does Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, actually <b>not know the reason for this matter?</b> The reason here is <b>just as it is</b> in the case of <b>a platform above</b> another <b>platform.</b> Even though it is not easy to climb, since it provides steps that can be climbed, albeit with difficulty, it is considered a valid passageway.<br><b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said:</b> The trunks of <b>palm trees in Babylonia</b> that were placed next to a wall between two courtyards so that people could climb on them and pass from one courtyard to another <b>do not need to be established</b> permanently and attached to the ground; rather, they serve to diminish the wall as they are. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>their heaviness establishes them</b> as connected to the ground. Although it is permitted to handle them, nevertheless, since their weight makes them difficult to move, they are considered fixed in place.<br><b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Yosef</b> said that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: Ladders in Babylonia do not need</b> to be <b>established</b> and fixed permanently in place. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>their heaviness establishes them,</b> as the ladders in Babylonia were typically large and heavy.<br>The Gemara comments: With regard to <b>the one who said</b> that Babylonian <b>ladders</b> do not need to be fixed in place, <b>all the more so</b> would he agree that the trunks of <b>palm trees,</b> which are placed there from the outset for this purpose, are considered fixed, as both are extremely heavy and also designed to remain in place. On the other hand, <b>the one who said</b> that the trunks of <b>palm trees</b> need not be fixed permanently in the ground, spoke only with regard to palm trees. <b>However,</b> as for <b>ladders, no,</b> they are not considered fixed in place. A ladder, even a heavy one, is designed to be moved from place to place.<br><b>Rav Yosef raised a dilemma before Rabba:</b> If there is a narrow <b>ladder</b> measuring less than two handbreadths wide <b>on one</b> side, <b>and a</b> similarly narrow <b>ladder on the other</b> side, <b>and</b> there are rungs of woven <b>straw in the middle</b> between them which would not support a person’s weight, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are the two ladders considered a single unit, forming a ladder four handbreadths wide, which serves to diminish the height of a wall?<br>Rabba <b>said to him: The sole of the foot cannot</b> climb <b>upon them.</b> A person usually places his foot in the middle of a ladder. Since the middle of this ladder is made of straw, then although it appears to be four handbreadths wide, it is not fit for use and does not diminish the height of the wall.<br>Rav Yosef continued to ask: And what if there were rungs of <b>straw on one</b> side <b>and</b> rungs of <b>straw on the other</b> side, <b>and a</b> narrow <b>ladder</b> less than four handbreadths wide <b>in the middle,</b> and their combined width is four handbreadths? <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Rabba <b>said to him: The sole of the foot can</b> climb <b>upon them,</b> and the ladder appears to be four handbreadths wide. Therefore, it serves to diminish the height of the wall.<br><br>Daf 78b<br><br>Rav Yosef further asked: If the ladder resting against the wall was less than four handbreadths wide, and <b>one dug out</b> grooves <b>in the wall</b> as extensions of the rungs of the ladder <b>to complete</b> the measure, <b>how</b> high must this hollowed-out section be to consider the ladder a valid passageway between the two courtyards? Rabba <b>said to him:</b> If it is <b>ten</b> handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, it is considered a passageway.<br>Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> If there was no ladder, and <b>one dug out the entire</b> ladder <b>in the wall,</b> so that all the steps are grooves in the wall, <b>how much</b> must he hollow out? Rabba <b>said to him:</b> Those steps must reach <b>the full height of</b> the wall. Rav Yosef asked: <b>And what is the difference</b> in this case? Why must the steps reach higher in this case than in the case where the hollowed-out section was merely an extension of an existing ladder? Rabba <b>said to him: There,</b> where there is a ladder, <b>it is easy to climb</b> to the top of the wall; however, <b>here,</b> where there are only grooves in the wall, <b>it is not easy to climb.</b> If one cannot reach the top of the wall, the steps are not considered a passageway between the courtyards.<br><b>Rav Yosef raised a dilemma before Rabba: If one designated a tree as a ladder, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Given that it is prohibited to climb a tree on Shabbat, if a tree stands next to a wall and it is easy to climb, is it considered with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat as an opening in the wall that can serve as a passageway between the two courtyards?<br><b>Let the dilemma be raised</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that a joining of Shabbat boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] placed in a tree is valid; and <b>let the dilemma be raised</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree.<br>The Gemara elaborates: <b>Let the dilemma be raised</b> according <b>to</b> the previously stated opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>only stated there</b> that with regard to <b>anything that is</b> prohibited on Shabbat <b>due to a rabbinic decree [<i>shevut</i>],</b> the Sages <b>did not prohibit</b> it during twilight. Therefore, in Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, it is permitted to use an <i>eiruv</i> that was deposited in a tree, as the use of a tree is prohibited on Shabbat by rabbinic decree. However, <b>this applies only</b> in that case, as the <i>eiruv</i> takes effect <b>during the twilight period.</b> Since there is doubt with regard to whether that period is considered day or night, the decree is not in force, and the <i>eiruv</i> is therefore valid. <b>However,</b> in this case, where the opening must be valid for <b>the entire day,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would <b>not</b> rule that the decree does not apply. Since it is prohibited by rabbinic decree to climb a tree on Shabbat, a tree cannot be considered a valid passageway.<br><b>Or perhaps</b> it may be argued that <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> this tree is considered an opening. They may have said that a joining of Shabbat boundaries placed in a tree is not valid only because the <i>eiruv</i> must actually be accessible during twilight, and in that case it is not, due to the rabbinic decree. However, in this case, where it is not necessary to make actual use of the tree, they would agree that a tree that serves as a ladder <b>is a</b> valid <b>entrance, but a lion crouches upon it.</b> Just as a lion crouching at an opening does not thereby nullify its status as an entrance, although in practice no one can pass through it, so too, in the case of the tree, the prohibition against climbing it does not nullify its status as a passageway.<br>Rav Yosef further inquired: <b>If one designated a tree worshipped as part of idolatrous rites [<i>asheira</i>],</b> from which it is forbidden to derive benefit, <b>as a ladder, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered a valid passageway in the wall with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat? Here, too, <b>let the dilemma be raised</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and <b>let the dilemma be raised</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b><br>The Gemara elaborates: <b>Let the dilemma be raised</b> according <b>to</b> the previously stated opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yehuda only stated there</b> that <b>it is permitted to acquire,</b> i.e., make use of, <b>a house</b> for the purposes of establishing an <i>eiruv</i> even if it is among the <b>items</b> from which it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit,</b> such as a grave. This statement applies only <b>there,</b> with regard to acquiring an <i>eiruv</i> in that location, <b>since after the <i>eiruv</i> has acquired</b> a place of residence <b>for him, it is not important to him that it is guarded.</b> He requires the grave only for the moment of the acquisition of the <i>eiruv</i>, and what happens to it afterward is of no consequence to him. However, here, since one desires the continued presence of the ladder, it is possible that even Rabbi Yehuda would agree that one may not rely on an <i>asheira</i>, as one may not climb and make use of it, since it is prohibited to derive benefit from it.<br><b>Or perhaps</b> it may be argued that <b>even</b> though according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> it is prohibited to use a grave to acquire an <i>eiruv</i>, here they would agree that the <i>asheira</i> <b>is an opening, but a lion crouches upon it,</b> and this does not nullify its status as an opening.<br>Rabba <b>said to him: A tree is permitted</b> for use as a ladder, <b>but an <i>asheira</i> is prohibited. Rav Ḥisda strongly objects to this: On the contrary, a tree,</b> with regard to <b>which a Shabbat prohibition causes it</b> to be prohibited, <b>should be prohibited,</b> so that it will not be said that a Shabbat prohibition has been disregarded in a case involving the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat.<br>And the converse is also true: <b>An <i>asheira</i>,</b> with regard to <b>which something else,</b> a <i>halakha</i> unrelated to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, <b>causes it</b> to be prohibited, <b>should not be prohibited.</b> Rather, it should be considered an opening with regard to Shabbat.<br>Indeed, <b>it was also stated: When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anything</b> with regard to <b>which a prohibition of Shabbat causes it</b> to be prohibited <b>is prohibited;</b> and conversely, <b>anything</b> with regard to <b>which something else causes it</b> to be prohibited <b>is permitted.</b><br>However, in contrast to Rav Yosef, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak taught as follows:</b> These questions are indeed dependent on the known disputes. Whether <b>a tree</b> serving as a ladder constitutes a valid opening <b>is</b> the subject of <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis;</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi permits it and the Rabbis prohibit it. The debate with regard to whether or not <b>an <i>asheira</i></b> is considered an opening <b>is</b> the subject of <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who permits using items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit for the sake of an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and the Rabbis,</b> who prohibit making an <i>eiruv</i> with such items.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a ditch between</b> two <b>courtyards</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> it is considered a full-fledged partition, and the residents of the courtyard <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i>,</b> one for each courtyard, <b>but they</b> may <b>not establish one <i>eiruv</i>. Even</b> if the ditch is <b>filled</b> with <b>straw or hay,</b> it is not regarded as sealed and is therefore not nullified. However, if the ditch is <b>filled with dirt or pebbles,</b> the residents <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>, but they</b> may <b>not establish two <i>eiruvin</i>,</b> as the ditch is nullified and considered nonexistent.<br>If <b>one placed a board four handbreadths wide across</b> the ditch so that he could cross it, <b>and similarly,</b> if <b>two balconies [<i>gezuztraot</i>]</b> in two different courtyards are <b>opposite one another,</b> and one placed a board four handbreadths wide between them, the residents of the courtyards or balconies <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, and if they desire, they</b> may <b>establish one,</b> as the board serves as an opening and a passageway between them. If the width of the plank is <b>less than</b> four handbreadths, the residents <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, but they</b> may <b>not establish one <i>eiruv</i>.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders: Does <b>hay not</b> constitute <b>a</b> proper <b>filling</b> to seal the ditch? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the following mishna: With regard to <b>a haystack ten handbreadths high</b> that stands <b>between two courtyards,</b> the residents of the two courtyards <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, but they</b> may <b>not establish one <i>eiruv</i>.</b> This indicates that hay can create a valid partition.<br><b>Abaye said</b> that the matter should be understood as follows: <b>With regard to a partition, everyone agrees that</b> hay <b>is a partition</b> and that it divides between the courtyards as long as it is placed there. <b>But with regard to filling</b> the ditch so that it is considered sealed, one must distinguish between two cases: <b>If one</b> explicitly <b>nullified</b> the hay and decided to leave it there, <b>it fills</b> and seals the ditch; <b>however, if he did not nullify it</b> but intends to remove the hay from the ditch, <b>it does not fill</b> it, and the ditch is not considered sealed.<br>It is written in the mishna: If the ditch is <b>filled with dirt</b> or pebbles, it is considered sealed. The Gemara asks: Does this apply <b>even if one did not specify</b> his intention to leave it there? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna with regard to the ritual impurity of a corpse: If there is <b>a house that one filled with hay or pebbles, and he nullified</b> the hay or pebbles and decided to leave them in the house, then the house (Rambam) <b>is nullified</b> and is no longer considered a house with partitions? Generally, a house containing a corpse is ritually impure on the inside but does not impart impurity to the surrounding area. However, in this case, the house is considered an enclosed grave that imparts ritual impurity to its surroundings.<br>And one can infer from the mishna: <b>If he nullified</b> the hay or pebbles, <b>yes,</b> the house is nullified and considered sealed.<br><br></body></html>
