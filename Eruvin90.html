Daf 90a<br><br><b>that he built</b> the upper story <b>to protect the garden [<i>tarbitza</i>],</b> not to access the roofs.<br><b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma:</b> According to Rav, who holds that one may carry only within four cubits on each roof, if he carries an object <b>two cubits on a roof and</b> another <b>two cubits on a pillar</b> ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide adjacent to the roof, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said:</b> With regard to <b>what</b> matter <b>is he raising a dilemma?</b> Is it with regard to <b>a <i>karmelit</i> and a private domain</b> that <b>he is raising a dilemma?</b> The roof is a <i>karmelit</i> and the pillar is a private domain; certainly carrying from one to the other is prohibited.<br>The Gemara explains that this was not in fact the dilemma, <b>and Rami bar Ḥama, due to his keen</b> mind, <b>did not analyze</b> the dilemma carefully and was imprecise in its formulation. <b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>dilemma he is raising:</b> If one carries an object <b>two cubits on the roof</b> of a house, <b>and</b> another <b>two cubits on</b> the slanted roof of <b>a portico,</b> a roofed structure without walls, before a house belonging to someone else, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?<br>The Gemara elaborates on Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since neither this</b> roof <b>is fit for residence, nor is this</b> portico roof <b>fit for residence, it is</b> regarded as <b>one domain,</b> and therefore carrying between them is permitted? <b>Or perhaps since</b> carrying <b>from a roof to</b> another <b>roof is prohibited,</b> carrying <b>from a roof to a portico is likewise prohibited,</b> as the latter is also a domain in and of itself.<br><b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye raised a</b> similar <b>dilemma:</b> If one carries <b>two cubits on the roof</b> of a house <b>and</b> another <b>two cubits</b> on the roof <b>of a ruin</b> belonging to someone else, one side of which was completely open to a public domain, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?<br><b>Rav Kahana said: Is that not</b> precisely the same dilemma raised <b>by Rami bar Ḥama</b> with regard to a portico? <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: And did I come late</b> [<b><i>me’aḥer</i></b>] merely <b>to quarrel,</b> and meddle in other people’s questions? That is not the case, as the two dilemmas are not identical. <b>A portico is not fit for residence, while a ruin is fit for residence.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> might differ in each case.<br>The Gemara is surprised by this explanation: <b>And now that it is fit for residence, what dilemma is he raising?</b> The situation is comparable to the case of two standard roofs. The Gemara answers: Rav Beivai was unaware of the resolution to the dilemma raised by Rami bar Ḥama, and therefore, <b>he states</b> the dilemma employing the style: <b>If you say. If you say</b> that <b>a portico is not fit for residence,</b> and therefore carrying is permitted, it can be argued that as <b>a ruin is fit for residence,</b> the legal status of its roof should be like that of a standard roof. <b>Or perhaps</b> that is not the case, as <b>now in any event there are no residents in</b> the ruin, and therefore its roof is not comparable to a standard roof. No resolution was found for these dilemmas, and they <b>stand</b> unresolved.<br>The Gemara discusses a different question. With regard to <b>roofs that are level,</b> i.e., with a height disparity of less than ten handbreadths, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, or an isolated roof</b> that does not border other roofs, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout the entire</b> roof; <b>and Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits.<br>The Gemara seeks to clarify the conflicting opinions. <b>Rav said</b> that <b>it is permitted to move</b> objects <b>throughout the entire</b> roof. This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav and</b> another statement <b>of Rav.</b> With regard to level roofs, Rav said that according to the Rabbis one may carry on each roof only within four cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a roof among roofs, <b>the</b> inner <b>partitions</b> between the houses <b>are not conspicuous,</b> and therefore, are not taken into consideration. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>the</b> outer <b>partitions</b> of a single house or group of houses <b>are conspicuous,</b> meaning that they are considered to extend upward and delineate the edge of the roof.<br>The Gemara returns to discuss Shmuel’s ruling. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four</b> cubits. Once again, it is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Shmuel and</b> another statement <b>of Shmuel,</b> who said that in the case of level roofs, according to the Rabbis one may carry throughout each separate roof. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the area of the roof <b>is no greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>;</b> whereas <b>here,</b> the area <b>is greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>. And these partitions</b> of the house <b>were erected</b> for use <b>below</b> as partitions for the residence itself; <b>they were not erected to</b> serve as partitions for use on the roof <b>above.</b> Consequently, even if the walls are viewed as extending upward so that they constitute surrounding partitions for the roof, the legal status of the roof is <b>like</b> that of <b>an enclosure greater than two <i>beit se’a</i> that was not enclosed</b> from the outset for the purpose of <b>residence; and</b> the principle is that with regard to <b>any enclosure greater than two <i>beit se’a</i> that was not enclosed</b> from the outset <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>residence, one may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four cubits.</b><br><b>It was</b> further <b>stated</b> that these same <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a</b> large <b>ship. Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout</b> the entire ship, as it is all one domain; <b>and Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits. The Gemara proceeds to clarify their respective opinions. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout</b> the boat,<br><br>Daf 90b<br><br><b>as there are partitions. And Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four cubits,</b> as <b>the partitions</b> of the ship are not considered full-fledged partitions; they <b>are erected</b> only <b>to keep water out,</b> not to render it a residence.<br><b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said to Shmuel:</b> Is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with your</b> opinion <b>or</b> is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav?</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> as his rationale is more convincing.<br><b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: And Rav concedes that if one overturned</b> the ship <b>onto its mouth,</b> and it is more than ten handbreadths high, <b>that one may move</b> an object <b>on it only within four cubits.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> purpose <b>was</b> the ship <b>overturned? If you say</b> it was overturned so <b>that</b> one may <b>reside beneath it, what is the difference</b> between it and <b>an isolated roof?</b> The legal status of the overturned ship should in every sense be that of a house, and therefore it should be permitted to carry throughout the entire ship.<br><b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that he overturned it to tar it,</b> i.e., to add a fresh coat to its underside. In that case, the boat certainly does not serve as a residence, and its sides are not considered full-fledged partitions.<br><b>Rav Ashi teaches</b> Shmuel’s acceptance of Rav’s opposing view (Ritva) with regard <b>to a ship,</b> as stated above; <b>and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches it</b> with regard <b>to a portico, as it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a portico</b> located <b>in a field.</b> A portico has a roof and either incomplete walls or no walls. Consequently, in the case of a portico located in a valley, which is a <i>karmelit</i>, it remains to be determined whether or not it is permitted to carry in it. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout the entire</b> portico, as it is a private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits.<br>The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout the entire</b> portico, as <b>we say: The edge of the roof descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals</b> the portico on all sides, rendering it a private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits, as <b>we do not say: The edge of the roof descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals</b> the portico.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rav’s</b> statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> that one is permitted to carry from one roof to another if they are level, it should also be permitted <b>to carry from a roof to a courtyard.</b> Why then does Rabbi Meir rule that roofs and courtyards are separate domains and that carrying between them is prohibited? The Gemara answers: It is prohibited because Rabbi Meir issued <b>a decree, due to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi.</b> As stated previously, Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi rules that one may not transfer objects between two halakhically equivalent but physically distinct domains ten or more handbreadths high. This is a decree lest one standing in a public domain adjust a burden on a mound ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, which is a private domain, an act prohibited by Torah law.<br>The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> according to <b>Shmuel’s</b> statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the legal status of an isolated roof greater than two <i>beit se’a</i> is that of a <i>karmelit</i>, it should be permitted <b>to move</b> an object <b>from</b> an isolated <b>roof to an enclosure</b> within four cubits of the roof, as the legal status of the enclosure is also that of a <i>karmelit</i>. Why then do the Rabbis rule that roofs and enclosures are separate domains and carrying from one to the other is prohibited? <b>Rava bar Ulla said:</b> It is prohibited because the Rabbis issued <b>a decree lest the</b> area of the <b>roof diminish</b> to less than two <i>beit se’a</i>, in which case it would assume the status of a private domain, as it is prohibited to carry between a private domain and an enclosure.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If so, one should also not</b> be permitted to <b>move</b> an object <b>from one enclosure to</b> another <b>enclosure,</b> due to the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the area of one of the enclosures will <b>diminish</b> and become a private domain, <b>and he</b> will <b>come</b> to <b>move</b> an object from one to the other as before. The Gemara answers: <b>There, if</b> the enclosure <b>is diminished, the matter is conspicuous,</b> as its walls are clearly visible. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>if</b> the roof <b>is diminished, the matter is not conspicuous,</b> as the roof does not have walls.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> After careful analysis, <b>you will find</b> that you can <b>say</b> that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Meir, roofs are a domain in and of themselves,</b> and one may carry from one roof to another; and likewise <b>courtyards are</b> considered <b>a domain in and of themselves,</b> and one may likewise carry from one courtyard to another.<br><br></body></html>
