Daf 67a<br><br>But <b>if</b> a resident <b>of the outer</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> it is <b>certainly permitted</b> to carry in the <b>inner</b> courtyard, <b>as</b> its residents <b>can close the door</b> between the two courtyards, thereby preventing the residents of the outer courtyard from entering, <b>and</b> they can then <b>use</b> their courtyard on their own. <b>However,</b> it is still <b>prohibited</b> to carry in <b>the outer</b> courtyard.<br><b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: And if a</b> resident <b>of the inner</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, why</b> is it <b>prohibited</b> to carry in <b>both</b> courtyards? <b>Let the resident of the inner</b> courtyard who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>renounce</b> his rights <b>in favor of the</b> other <b>residents of the inner courtyard, and</b> then <b>let</b> the residents of <b>the outer</b> courtyard, who had established an <i>eiruv</i> with the inner one, <b>come and be permitted</b> to carry together <b>with them.</b><br>Rava replied: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion do you make this suggestion? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: It is not necessary to renounce</b> one’s <b>rights in favor of each and every</b> resident. Rather, it is enough for a person to renounce his rights in favor of a single person, as once he no longer has any rights in the courtyard, he can no longer render it prohibited to carry there. According to this approach, a resident of the inner courtyard may indeed renounce his rights in favor of the other residents of his courtyard. The outer courtyard would then be rendered permitted together with the inner courtyard. However, <b>when I spoke,</b> it was <b>in accordance with the</b> opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: It is necessary to renounce</b> one’s rights <b>in favor of each and every</b> resident. Therefore, in order to render the outer courtyard permitted, it would be necessary for the person who forgot to establish the <i>eiruv</i> to renounce his rights in favor of the residents of the outer courtyard as well. However, he may not do so, as one may not renounce rights from one courtyard to another. Therefore, the outer courtyard may not be rendered permitted in this manner.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Ḥisda and Rav Sheshet would meet each other, Rav Ḥisda’s lips would tremble from the teachings of Rav Sheshet.</b> Rav Sheshet’s fluency and expertise were such that Rav Ḥisda would be filled with awe in his presence. For his part, <b>Rav Sheshet’s entire body would shake from Rav Ḥisda’s sharpness,</b> i.e., from his brilliant, analytical mind.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> If there were <b>two</b> unconnected <b>houses on two sides of a public domain, and gentiles came and enclosed them</b> in <b>a partition on Shabbat, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? By erecting the fence, the gentiles nullified the public domain between the two houses, turning it into a private domain. Consequently, carrying from one house to the other is permitted by Torah law. The question is: Is it possible to render it permitted to carry even by rabbinic law? Can one resident renounce his rights to the area between the houses and thereby allow the other to carry there?<br>The Gemara clarifies the question: <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that <b>there is no renouncing of rights from one courtyard to another, you have no dilemma,</b> as carrying is certainly prohibited. <b>Now, if</b> in a case <b>where had they wanted to establish an <i>eiruv</i> yesterday they could have established an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> e.g., in a case of two adjacent courtyards with an entranceway between them, <b>you say</b> that <b>there is no renouncing of rights from one courtyard to another,</b> then <b>here,</b> in a case of two houses situated on opposite sides of a public domain, <b>where had they wanted to establish an <i>eiruv</i> yesterday they could not have established an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> because of the public domain between the houses, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that there is no renouncing of rights?<br><b>Where you have a dilemma is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that <b>there is renouncing of rights from one courtyard to another,</b> and the two sides of the question are as follows: Perhaps <b>there, where had they wanted to establish an <i>eiruv</i> yesterday they could have established an <i>eiruv</i></b> then, <b>they can also renounce</b> rights now. <b>But here, where they could not have established an <i>eiruv</i> yesterday</b> even had they wanted to, <b>one</b> may <b>not renounce rights</b> now <b>either.</b><br><b>Or perhaps</b> there is <b>no difference</b> between the two cases. Since renunciation of rights is possible under the current circumstances, yesterday’s situation is not taken into account. Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: In such a case, <b>one</b> may <b>not renounce</b> his rights.<br>Rav Ḥisda posed a similar question: If two Jews and a gentile shared a courtyard, and no steps had been taken prior to Shabbat to render it permitted to carry in the courtyard, <b>and the gentile died on Shabbat, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Since the gentile died, he no longer imposes restrictions on carrying in the courtyard. May one Jew now renounce his rights in favor of the other and thereby render it permitted for him to carry in the courtyard?<br>The Gemara clarifies the question: <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>rent</b> from a gentile who arrives on Shabbat, <b>you have no dilemma. Now</b> that <b>we</b> may <b>perform two</b> actions, both rent and renounce rights, as the Jewish neighbors may rent from the gentile and subsequently each could renounce his rights in favor of the other, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that we may perform <b>one</b> action? Each Jew may certainly renounce his rights in favor of the other.<br><b>Rather, there is a dilemma in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that <b>they</b> may <b>not rent</b> from the gentile in such a case. The two sides of the question are as follows: Perhaps <b>it is two</b> actions <b>that we</b> may <b>not perform,</b> rent and renounce; <b>however, one</b> action alone <b>we</b> may <b>perform; or perhaps</b> there is <b>no difference</b> between one action and two. Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>I say</b> that in such a case <b>one</b> may <b>renounc</b>e his rights, <b>while</b> Rav <b>Hamnuna said</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not renounce</b> his rights.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who</b> lives in a courtyard that opens into an alleyway in which many Jews reside, and he <b>has</b> another <b>entrance</b> on the other side of the courtyard, even one that is only <b>four by four</b> handbreadths in size, that <b>opens into a valley,</b> then in such a case, <b>even if all day</b> long <b>he brings camels and wagons in and out</b> of his courtyard <b>by way of the alleyway,</b> so that it is evident that he uses the alleyway, <b>he</b> nonetheless <b>does not render it prohibited for the residents of the alleyway</b> to carry. He is not considered a resident of the alleyway alongside them, as the entrance from the field is viewed as the true entrance to his courtyard.<br><b>What is the reason</b> that his small entrance from the field is considered his main entrance? Because <b>the entrance that is exclusively his is preferable to him.</b> Despite its small size, the gentile views the entrance from the field as his main entrance, while he uses the one that opens into the alleyway only when it is convenient.<br>Based on this assumption, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the gentile’s courtyard opens into an alleyway in which Jews reside, and it also has an entrance that <b>opens into an enclosure</b> rather than into a valley, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Which entrance is considered his primary entrance? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Ami said, citing a tradition [<i>mishmei de’ulpana</i>]</b> he received from his teachers:<br><br>Daf 67b<br><br><b>Even</b> if it <b>opens into an enclosure,</b> this is considered its main entrance, rather than the one that opens into the alleyway.<br>It is <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef who both say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in such a case depends on the identity of the owner of the courtyard. With regard to a courtyard owned by <b>a gentile,</b> if the enclosure behind his courtyard is the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i></b> or less, <b>he renders it prohibited</b> for the Jewish residents of the alleyway to carry. An enclosure of this size is not large enough for all the gentile’s needs, and therefore his main entrance is the one that opens into the alleyway. However, if the enclosure is <b>greater than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, he does not render it prohibited</b> for the residents of the alleyway to carry, as such an enclosure is sufficient for all his needs.<br>On the other hand, with regard to a courtyard owned by <b>a Jew,</b> if the enclosure is the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i></b> or less, <b>he does not render it prohibited</b> for the other residents of the alleyway to carry, even if he did not join in an <i>eiruv</i> with them. Because he has the option of carrying in such an enclosure on Shabbat, he would not carry in the alleyway, as it is more convenient for him to carry in a place that belongs exclusively to him.<br>However, if the enclosure is <b>greater than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> in which case it is prohibited to carry there, the Jew would carry only by way of the alleyway. Therefore, <b>he renders it prohibited</b> for his fellow residents of the alleyway to carry unless he establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with them.<br>With regard to this issue, <b>Rava bar Ḥaklai raised a dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> If the gentile’s courtyard opens into an alleyway, and it also has an entrance that <b>opens into an enclosure, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? He <b>said to him: They have</b> already <b>said</b> that if the enclosure is the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i></b> or less, the gentile <b>renders it prohibited</b> for the Jewish residents of the alleyway to carry; however, if it is <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>, he does not render it prohibited</b> for them to carry.<br><b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>an enclosure greater than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> that was not</b> originally <b>surrounded</b> by a fence <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>residence, even</b> if it is as large as a field that produces a crop of one <b><i>kor</i>, and even two <i>kor</i>, one who</b> inadvertently <b>throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering, like one who throws into a private domain. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because the partition of an enclosure <b>is a</b> valid <b>partition.</b> Consequently, the enclosure is considered a private domain by Torah law, <b>except that it is lacking residents,</b> and therefore the Sages did not permit one to carry inside it as in a proper private domain.<br><b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rock</b> protruding from <b>the sea</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide, one</b> may <b>not carry from it to the sea or from the sea to it</b> on Shabbat. The rock has the status of a private domain, while the sea is a <i>karmelit</i>, and it is prohibited to carry from a private domain into a <i>karmelit</i> or vice versa on Shabbat. If the rock <b>is smaller than this,</b> either in height or width, so that it is no longer considered a private domain, <b>one</b> may <b>carry</b> to or from it. <b>How large</b> may the rock be? It may be <b>up to</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>.</b><br>The Gemara attempts to clarify the meaning of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>To which</b> part of the <i>baraita</i> is the clause: Up to the size of two <i>beit se’a</i>, referring? <b>If you say</b> it is referring <b>to the latter clause,</b> can it be that with regard to a rock that is less than ten handbreadths high, the <i>halakha</i> is that carrying is permitted if the rock is up to the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> but <b>no more</b> than that? <b>Wouldn’t he be carrying from one <i>karmelit</i> to another,</b> which is certainly permitted?<br><b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and this is</b> what <b>it is saying:</b> With regard to <b>a rock</b> protruding from <b>the sea</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide, one may not carry from it to the sea or from the sea to it,</b> as it has the status of a private domain. <b>And how large</b> may it be for this prohibition to apply? <b>Up to</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>. But</b> if the rock is <b>greater than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, one</b> may <b>carry. Apparently,</b> it <b>is a <i>karmelit</i></b> in all respects, and not just as a stringency. This appears to be <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b><br><b>Rava said:</b> Only <b>one who does not know how to explain <i>mishnayot</i> raises</b> such <b>refutations against Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> one of the greatest Sages of his generation. Rather, the <i>baraita</i> is to be understood as follows: <b>Actually,</b> the final words of the <i>baraita</i> refer <b>to the first clause, and this is</b> what <b>it is saying:</b> With regard to a rock protruding from the sea that is ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, one may not carry from it to the sea or from the sea to it, <b>but within it,</b> on the rock itself, <b>one</b> may <b>carry,</b> as it is considered a private domain. And <b>how large</b> may the rock be and remain permitted? <b>Up to two <i>beit se’a</i>.</b><br><b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> may be explained differently, yet still in a manner that does not refute the words of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Actually,</b> the final words of the <i>baraita</i> refer <b>to the first clause,</b> as stated by Rav Huna bar Ḥanina. However, one may not infer from them a principle with regard to enclosures, as <b>they said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in one case, <b>and they said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> should be lenient in a different case, i.e., the same Sages who were stringent in one case were lenient in another.<br>How so? <b>They said</b> that in the case of <b>an enclosure greater than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> that was not</b> originally <b>enclosed</b> with a fence <b>for</b> the purpose of residence, <b>one</b> may <b>carry only</b> a distance of <b>four cubits,</b> as it has the status of a <i>karmelit</i> in this regard. <b>And they</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not carry from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i>.</b> Both of these <i>halakhot</i> are decrees of the Sages.<br>Therefore, the Sages developed the following principles: With regard to a rock that is no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> so <b>that it is permitted to carry on all of it, the Sages prohibited carrying from the sea to it and from it to the sea. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that the rock <b>is a full-fledged private domain,</b> and they did not permit one to carry from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i> or vice versa.<br>However, if it is <b>larger than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> so <b>that it is prohibited to carry on all of it</b> by rabbinic decree, <b>the Sages permitted carrying from the sea to it and from it to the sea. What is the reason</b> for this? It is because the Sages were concerned that <b>perhaps</b> people would <b>say</b> that <b>it is a proper private domain, and they would come to carry on all of it.</b> Were the Sages to prohibit carrying from the rock to the sea, people would think that it is a full-fledged private domain, and they would carry on it. Since all these decrees are rabbinic in nature, the Sages permitted carrying from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i> in this case in order to prevent people from violating a different rabbinic decree, which prohibits carrying in an enclosure that is greater than the size of two <i>beit se’a</i>. However, no general conclusion may be inferred from this that an enclosure larger than two <i>beit se’a</i> is not a private domain by Torah law.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the difference</b> between the decrees that caused the Sages to choose to uphold the one decree and not the other? The Gemara answers: The difference is that carrying <b>within</b> the rock <b>is common,</b> whereas carrying <b>from it to the sea and from the sea to it is not common.</b> The Sages permitted carrying in the less likely scenario in order to reinforce the decree against carrying within the rock, the more common situation.<br>The Gemara now relates that there was once <b>a certain baby whose warm water,</b> which had been prepared for his Shabbat circumcision, <b>spilled. Rabba said to them: Let them bring warm water for him from my house. Abaye said to him: But we did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> in the courtyard, so it is prohibited to carry the water.<br>Rabba <b>said to him: Let us rely on the merging</b> of alleyways, which may serve in place of a joining of courtyards in pressing circumstances such as these. Abaye <b>said to him: But we did not establish a merging</b> of alleyways either. Rabba replied: If so, <b>let them instruct a gentile to bring</b> the warm water <b>for him,</b> even though it is generally prohibited to instruct a gentile to perform labor for a Jew that involves a desecration of Shabbat.<br><b>Abaye said: I wanted to raise an objection against the Master,</b> Rabba, <b>but Rav Yosef would not let me</b> do so, as <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Kahana said: When we were in Rav Yehuda’s house, he would say to us</b> when we were presented with a halakhic difficulty: With regard to <b>a Torah law, we</b> first <b>raise objections and then we perform an act,</b> i.e., if someone has an objection to a proposed action, we must first clarify the matter and only then may we proceed. However, <b>with regard to rabbinic laws, we</b> first <b>perform an act and then</b> we <b>raise objections.</b><br><b>Afterward,</b> when they had brought the water, Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>What objection did you wish to raise against the Master,</b> Rabba? He <b>said to him: As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Sprinkling</b> the water of purification on an impure person on Shabbat is not prohibited by Torah law; rather, it is only <b>a rabbinic decree</b> to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest. <b>And telling a gentile</b> to perform a Shabbat labor on behalf of a Jew is likewise only <b>a rabbinic decree.</b><br><br></body></html>
