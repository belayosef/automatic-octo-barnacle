Daf 24a<br><br><b>is nullified</b> relative <b>to the greater part,</b> and it is as though the <i>karpef</i> were entirely sown. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>it is</b> regarded as <b>a <i>karpef</i> greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> in which it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry.<br><b>Rather, if this was stated, this is what was stated</b> by Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: If the greater part of the <i>karpef</i> was sown, it is prohibited to carry within it. It follows that if only a <b>minor</b> part of the <i>karpef</i> was sown, it is <b>permitted</b> to carry within it. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: We said</b> that it is permitted to carry <b>only</b> if the sown section <b>is not</b> as large as <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, however,</b> if it is at least <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry anywhere in the <i>karpef</i>, even though most of it is not sown.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>According to whose</b> opinion was this stated? It is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Shimon and say that a <i>karpef</i> and a courtyard are regarded as separate domains, so that it is prohibited to carry from one to the other.<br><b>And Rav Yirmeya from Difti would teach</b> this matter <b>as a leniency,</b> as follows: It was stated that if the greater part of the <i>karpef</i> was sown, it is prohibited to carry within it. From here it follows that if only a <b>minor</b> part was sown, it <b>is permitted</b> to carry within it. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua said: We only said</b> that it is permitted to carry if the sown section is not more than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, but</b> if it is <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry. <b>According to whose</b> opinion was this stated? It was <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b><br>It was stated earlier that if <b>the greater part of</b> the <i>karpef</i> <b>was planted</b> with trees, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like a courtyard, and</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to carry. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Avimi said: This is</b> only if the trees <b>were planted in rows [<i>itztablaot</i>],</b> the customary manner of planting ornamental trees in a courtyard. But if they were arranged differently it is considered an orchard, which is not made for dwelling, and where it is prohibited to carry. <b>But Rav Naḥman said:</b> This applies <b>even if they were not planted in rows,</b> as people commonly plant trees in any arrangement in the courtyards of their houses.<br><b>Mar Yehuda happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Huna bar Yehuda,</b> where <b>he saw certain</b> trees <b>that were not planted in rows, and</b> people <b>were</b> nevertheless <b>carrying among them.</b> Mar Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance <b>with this</b> opinion <b>of Avimi?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: I hold like</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> that it is permitted to carry even if the trees are not planted in rows.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>karpef</i> that is greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> and <b>which was not enclosed</b> from the outset <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>residence, what should one do</b> if he wishes to carry within it? <b>He should make a breach</b> in the fence <b>larger than ten</b> cubits, which nullifies the partition, <b>and</b> then <b>fence it off and reduce</b> the opening <b>to</b> only <b>ten</b> cubits, which thereby creates an entrance. He <b>is</b> then <b>permitted</b> to carry in the <i>karpef</i>, because it is now regarded as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence.<br>The Gemara <b>raises a dilemma:</b> If he did not make the breach at once, but rather <b>he breached one cubit and fenced off</b> that same <b>cubit, and</b> then <b>breached</b> another <b>cubit and fenced it off, until he completed</b> the breaching and fencing off of <b>more than ten</b> cubits, <b>what is</b> the law?<br><b>He said to him: Is this not as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>All</b> ritually impure wooden <b>utensils belonging to</b> ordinary <b>homeowners</b> become ritually pure through breaking the utensil, if they have holes <b>the size of pomegranates.</b><br><b>And Ḥizkiya raised a dilemma:</b> If a utensil <b>was perforated</b> with a hole large enough <b>for an olive to emerge, and he sealed it, and then it was perforated again</b> with a hole large enough <b>for an olive to emerge, and he sealed it</b> again, and this went on <b>until</b> the holes together <b>completed</b> a space large enough for <b>a pomegranate to emerge, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? In other words, is the ruling that because the sum of all the holes is the size of a pomegranate the utensil is pure, or is the ruling that it remains ritually impure because each hole was filled before the next hole was formed?<br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> his student <b>said to him: Master, you taught us</b> that with regard to a <b>sandal that</b> became ritually impure by impurity imparted by the treading of a <i>zav</i>, and <b>one of its ears,</b> i.e., straps, <b>broke and he repaired it,</b> it remains <b>ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>treading [</b><i>midras</i><b>]</b> and can still render people and utensils ritually impure. If one of a sandal’s straps is torn, it can still be used as a sandal, and therefore it does not lose its status as a utensil.<br><b>If the</b> second <b>ear</b> broke and he repaired it, it is <b>ritually pure</b> in the sense that it no longer renders other objects ritually impure as would a vessel that became a primary source of ritual impurity <b>by means of</b> impurity imparted by <b>treading. However,</b> the sandal itself is <b>ritually impure</b> due to <b>contact</b> with an object that became ritually impure with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> i.e., the sandal before its second strap ripped. Therefore, it can transmit ritual impurity to food and liquids.<br><b>And you said about this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>What is different</b> in a case where <b>the first</b> ear breaks, that the sandal remains impure? It is <b>because</b> the <b>second</b> one is <b>intact.</b> However, when the <b>second</b> ear breaks, the <b>first</b> ear is <b>intact;</b> so how does the sandal lose its utensil status?<br><b>And</b> then <b>you said to us</b> with regard to <b>this</b> that the reason it is no longer a utensil is because <b>a new entity has arrived here.</b> The legal status of the sandal with the two repaired ears is not that of the original sandal; it is a new sandal. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to a utensil that was perforated several times, where the sum of all the holes adds up to the size of a pomegranate, let us say that <b>a new entity has arrived here,</b> as the entire area of the hole is completely new, and the utensil is no longer the same utensil that had been ritually impure.<br>Ḥizkiya was so impressed by Rabbi Yoḥanan’s comment that <b>he exclaimed about him: This is not a human being;</b> rather, he is an angel, as he is capable of resolving a problem that I struggle with, from something that I myself taught. <b>Some say</b> that he said: <b>This is an</b> ideal <b>human being.</b> This parallel analysis teaches that if one breached one cubit and fenced it off, breached another cubit and fenced it off, and continued this way until he breached and fenced off more than ten cubits, then this is effective, and he need not breach more than ten meters at once.<br><b>Rav Kahana said: A</b> fenced-in <b>yard</b> located <b>behind</b> a group of <b>houses,</b> which is used to store objects not in regular use and which measures more than two <i>beit se’a</i>, is not treated as a full-fledged private domain. Therefore, <b>inside it, one may carry</b> objects a distance of <b>only four cubits.</b><br><b>Rav Naḥman said: If one opened an entrance to it</b> from the house, <b>it is permitted to carry throughout the entire</b> area, because <b>the entrance permits it,</b> allowing it to be considered as part of the house. <b>And we stated</b> this allowance <b>only where he opened</b> the entrance <b>and afterward fenced in</b> the area; <b>but if he</b> first <b>fenced it in and</b> only <b>afterward opened</b> the entrance, he may <b>not</b> carry throughout the yard.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: If he first <b>opened</b> the entrance <b>and afterward fenced in</b> the area, it is <b>obvious</b> that it is permitted to carry throughout the yard, because it is clear that the area was enclosed for the entrance, i.e., in order to use it from the house. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is necessary only</b> in the case <b>where there is a threshing floor</b> in the yard. This is because <b>you might have said</b> that <b>he made</b> the entrance <b>with the threshing floor in mind,</b> and not so that he would be able to use the entire yard. <b>He</b> therefore comes and <b>teaches us</b> that the entrance renders it permitted to carry in the yard in all cases.<br>The Gemara considers a new case: With regard to <b>a <i>karpef</i></b> measuring <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>, which had been enclosed for</b> the purpose of <b>residence but became filled with water,</b> by floods or any other cause, <b>the Rabbis thought to say</b> that the water <b>is</b> considered <b>like seeds.</b> This means that the <i>karpef</i> is regarded as if it were sown with seeds, so that it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry. It is no longer considered as having been enclosed for the purpose of dwelling, since it is not normal to live in a place filled with water.<br><b>Rav Abba, father of Rav, son of Rav Mesharshiya, said: We say in the name of Rava as follows: Water is</b> considered <b>like planted</b> trees, so that one <b>is permitted</b> to carry. A courtyard filled with water is still suitable for dwelling, since the water benefits the residents of the courtyard.<br><br>Daf 24b<br><br><b>Ameimar said: This</b> ruling <b>applies only if</b> the water <b>is fit for</b> its regular <b>use,</b> i.e., for drinking, because in that case it provides for the needs of residence. <b>However,</b> if the water <b>is not fit for use,</b> then it is <b>not</b> considered like planted trees. Therefore, the <i>karpef</i> is no longer considered enclosed for the purpose of residence, and it is prohibited to carry in the <i>karpef</i>.<br><b>Rav Ashi said: And</b> even where the water <b>is fit for use, this</b> ruling <b>applies only if</b> the water <b>is not</b> ten handbreadths <b>deep</b> over an area <b>greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>; but if</b> the water is ten handbreadths <b>deep</b> over an area <b>greater</b> than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry in it, as in such a case the <i>karpef</i> is no longer considered enclosed for the sake of dwelling.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>And it is not so, just as</b> it is <b>in</b> the case of <b>a pile of fruit,</b> as even if the pile of fruit is very large, the <i>karpef</i> does not lose its status as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence.<br>The Gemara relates: <b>There was a certain yard in</b> the town of <b>Pum Nahara</b> that was larger than two <i>beit se’a</i> and that had not been enclosed for the purpose of residence. <b>One of its sides opened to</b> an alleyway in <b>the town, and the other opened to a</b> walled <b>path between the vineyards, and</b> that <b>vineyard path led to the bank of a river</b> ten handbreadths high, which is considered a partition.<br><b>Abaye said: What shall we do</b> to permit carrying in the yard, which is a <i>karmelit</i>, without having to make a breach in one of its walls wider than ten cubits and then fence it up again? <b>Shall we construct a partition for it on the river bank,</b> so that the vineyard path is surrounded by partitions on all sides? This is not a viable solution, as <b>one cannot construct an</b> effective <b>partition on top of another</b> partition that already exists, and the river bank is considered a partition relative to the river.<br><b>Shall we arrange a doorframe at the mouth of the vineyard path?</b> That is also not an effective solution in this case, for <b>the camels</b> that walk down this path in order to drink water from the river <b>will come and knock it over.</b><br><b>Rather, Abaye said: We should arrange a side post at the opening of the vineyard path</b> to the yard, <b>since as it is effective for the vineyard path,</b> to allow one to carry on the path, as it is no longer breached into a <i>karmelit</i>, <b>it is also effective for the yard,</b> and the side post will be considered an additional partition that renders it permitted to carry in the yard.<br><b>Rava said to him:</b> If so, people <b>will say</b> that <b>a side post is effective</b> in permitting one to carry in <b>a vineyard path generally,</b> and this will cause the public to err, as vineyard paths are usually open at both ends and do not lead to a river or the like.<br><b>Rather, Rava said: They should arrange a side post at the opening</b> of the yard <b>to the town, as since the side post is effective</b> and is considered a partition <b>for the town, it is also effective for the yard,</b> to permit one to carry within it.<br><b>Therefore,</b> in summary, <b>it is permitted to carry within the town itself</b> and <b>to carry within the yard itself.</b> However, with regard to carrying <b>from the town to the yard or from the yard to the town, Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree: One prohibits</b> doing so <b>and the other permits</b> it.<br><br></body></html>
