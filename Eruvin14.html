Daf 14a<br><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the statement in the mishna with regard to the minimum width of the cross beam: <b>A handbreadth? A handbreadth and a half is required,</b> as a small brick is a handbreadth and a half wide.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the cross beam <b>is wide enough to receive</b> and hold <b>a handbreadth, one can affix the remaining half handbreadth with plaster,</b> a small <b>amount on this side and a</b> small <b>amount on</b> that <b>side, and</b> the brick will <b>stand</b> in place.<br><b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: The</b> cross <b>beam of which</b> the Sages <b>spoke must be sturdy enough to receive</b> and hold <b>a small brick; however, the supports of the</b> cross <b>beam need not be sturdy</b> enough <b>to receive</b> and hold a cross <b>beam and a small brick.</b> Criteria were established for the cross beam itself, which renders the alleyway fit for one to carry within it; criteria were not established for its supports. <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> disagreed and <b>said: Both this,</b> the beam, <b>and that,</b> its supports, <b>must be sturdy</b> enough <b>to hold</b> a cross <b>beam and a small brick.</b><br><b>Rav Sheshet said: If one placed</b> a cross <b>beam over</b> the entrance <b>of an alleyway, and draped a mat over it, and raised</b> the lower end of the mat <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the ground, there is neither</b> a cross <b>beam here, nor is there a partition here</b> to render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it. <b>There is neither</b> a cross <b>beam here, as it is obscured</b> and therefore inconspicuous. <b>Nor is there a partition here, as it is a partition</b> that is more than three handbreadths off the ground <b>through which goats can pass,</b> and therefore it does not have the legal status of a partition.<br><b>Our Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>If</b> a cross <b>beam projects from this wall</b> of an alleyway <b>but does not touch that wall</b> opposite, <b>and similarly,</b> if there are <b>two</b> cross <b>beams, one projecting from this wall and one projecting from that wall</b> opposite, <b>and they do not touch one another,</b> if there is a gap of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths between the beam and the wall, or between the two beams respectively, <b>one need not bring another</b> cross <b>beam</b> to render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it, as they are considered joined based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>. However, if there is a gap of <b>three</b> handbreadths, <b>one must bring another</b> cross <b>beam.</b><br><b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If the gap is <b>less than four</b> handbreadths, <b>one need not bring another</b> cross <b>beam.</b> However, if it is <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>he must bring another</b> cross <b>beam,</b> as in his opinion the principle of <i>lavud</i> applies to a gap up to four handbreadths wide.<br><b>And similarly,</b> if <b>two matching,</b> extremely narrow cross <b>beams</b> are placed alongside each other, even though <b>there is not</b> sufficient width <b>in this</b> beam <b>to receive a small brick, and there is not</b> sufficient width <b>in that</b> beam, <b>if</b> the two beams together can <b>receive a small brick along its handbreadth width, one need not bring another</b> cross <b>beam</b> to render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it; <b>but if not, one is required to bring another</b> cross <b>beam.</b><br><b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If</b> the two cross beams can <b>receive a small brick along its length,</b> which is <b>three</b> handbreadths, <b>one need not bring another</b> cross <b>beam, but if not, one must bring another</b> cross <b>beam.</b><br><b>If</b> these two narrow cross beams <b>are</b> placed <b>one above and one below, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: One considers the upper</b> one <b>as though it were below, and the lower one as though it were above,</b> i.e., close together. If the two together are fit to hold a small brick, they render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it, although they are not actually close to each other, <b>provided that the upper</b> cross <b>beam is not above twenty cubits and the lower</b> one is not <b>below ten</b> handbreadths, between which a cross beam renders an alleyway fit for one to carry within it.<br><b>Abaye said: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father with regard to one</b> matter, <b>and disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> matter. <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father in one</b> matter, <b>as he is</b> of the opinion that the principle: <b>One considers,</b> applies. Just as Rabbi Yehuda stated in the mishna that the cross beam is considered as though it were sturdy even though it is not, his son, Rabbi Yosei, holds that one considers two cross beams placed apart as though they were adjacent.<br><b>And</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>disagrees with his</b> father’s opinion <b>with regard to one</b> matter. <b>While Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that a cross beam renders an alleyway fit for one to carry within it even if it is <b>higher than twenty</b> cubits, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds: Within twenty cubits, yes,</b> it renders the alleyway fit for one to carry within it; <b>above twenty,</b> it does <b>not.</b><br>It was stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It suffices if the cross beam is <b>wide</b> enough to hold a small brick, <b>even though it is not sturdy</b> enough to actually support it. <b>Rav Yehuda taught</b> this clause of the mishna <b>to Ḥiyya bar Rav in the presence of Rav:</b> It suffices if the cross beam is <b>wide</b> enough to hold a small brick, <b>even though it is not sturdy</b> enough to actually support it. Rav <b>said to him: Teach</b> it to <b>him</b> as follows: <b>Wide</b> enough <b>and sturdy</b> enough to hold a small brick.<br>The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Elai say</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> A cross beam that is <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>wide</b> renders an alleyway fit for one to carry within it <b>even if it is not sturdy</b> enough to hold a small brick? The Gemara answers: A cross beam that is <b>four handbreadths wide is different,</b> as a beam of that width is considered a roof and not a beam. It is considered as though the edge of the roof descended and constituted an actual partition, not merely a conspicuous distinction.<br>It was stated in the mishna: Even <b>if</b> the cross beam <b>is</b> made <b>of straw</b> or reeds, one considers it as though it were made of metal. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>teaching us?</b> If it is teaching <b>that we say one considers</b> the cross beam as though it were fit to bear a brick, then <b>this</b> clause <b>is the same as the</b> previous clause in the mishna: Wide enough even though it is not sturdy enough.<br>The Gemara answers: There is a novel point here, <b>lest you say</b> that with regard to a cross beam made of material that other beams <b>of its own kind</b> are sturdy, e.g., wood, <b>we say</b> that even the flimsiest of cross beams is considered sturdy. However, with regard to a cross beam made of material that only beams <b>not of its own kind</b> are sturdy, e.g., straw, which can never support a brick, <b>we do not say</b> that one considers the cross beam as if it were made of metal. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that there is no difference between the cases.<br>It was taught in the mishna: If the cross beam is <b>curved, one considers it as though it were straight.</b> The Gemara challenges: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers that this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira said:</b> If the cross beam <b>is inside the alleyway, and its curved</b> section <b>is outside the alleyway;</b> or <b>it is within twenty</b> cubits of the ground, <b>and its curved</b> section <b>is above twenty</b> cubits; or <b>it is above ten</b> handbreadths, <b>and its curved</b> section <b>is below ten</b> handbreadths, meaning that the curved part of the beam is outside the area where a cross beam is effective, <b>one considers</b> the situation: In <b>any</b> case <b>where, were the curved</b> section outside the area where a cross beam is effective <b>removed, there would not be</b> a gap of <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>between this</b> effective part of the cross beam <b>and that</b> effective part of the cross beam, <b>one need not bring another</b> cross <b>beam. And if not,</b> if the gap would be greater, <b>he must bring another</b> cross <b>beam.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>That too is obvious,</b> as the curved portion of the cross beam is considered as though it were straight. The Gemara explains: In a case where the cross beam <b>is inside the alleyway and its curved</b> portion <b>is outside the alleyway, it was necessary for him</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i>. <b>Lest you say: Let us be concerned that he</b> will <b>come to be drawn after it</b> and carry in the area where the curvature extends beyond the alleyway, Rabbi Zeira <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.<br>The mishna continues: If the cross beam is <b>round, one considers it as though it were square.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need this</b> clause <b>as well?</b> Similar cases were already taught in the mishna. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach <b>the last clause</b> of this section, i.e., the principle that <b>any</b> circle <b>with a circumference of three handbreadths is a handbreadth in diameter.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> this ratio between circumference and diameter, derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the verse said</b> with regard to King Solomon: <b>“And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: It was round all about, and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits did circle it round about”</b> (I Kings 7:23).<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there its brim</b> that must be taken into account? The diameter of the sea was measured from the inside, and if its circumference was measured from the outside, this ratio is no longer accurate.<br><b>Rav Pappa said: With regard to its brim, it is written</b> that <b>the brim</b> is as <b>the petals of a lily,</b> as stated in the verse: <b>“And it was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was wrought as the brim of a cup, as the petals of a lily; it contained two thousand <i>bat</i>”</b> (I Kings 7:26). The brim was very thin.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> nevertheless, <b>isn’t there</b> the minimal <b>amount</b> of the thickness of the brim? The Gemara answers: <b>When one calculates</b> the circumference, <b>he calculates from the inside.</b><br><b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The sea that Solomon fashioned contained</b> a volume of <b>one hundred and fifty baths of ritual purification.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>After all,</b> with regard to <b>a ritual bath, how much is</b> its volume? It is <b>forty <i>se’a</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And he shall bathe his flesh</b><br><br>Daf 14b<br><br><b>in water</b>; specifically <b>in the water of a ritual bath.</b> The expression <b>“all his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:16) teaches that one must immerse in <b>water that his whole body can enter</b> at once. <b>And how much is that? A cubit by a cubit by the height of three cubits. And the Sages calculated</b> that the volume of <b>water</b> necessary for <b>a ritual bath</b> of this size <b>is forty <i>se’a</i>.</b><br>The Gemara now calculates <b>how many</b> ritual baths should have been contained in Solomon’s Sea. The volume of the sea was <b>five hundred</b> cubic <b>cubits,</b> as it was ten cubits in length, ten cubits in width, and five cubits in height. The minimum volume of a ritual bath is three cubic cubits. Therefore, <b>three hundred</b> cubic cubits is the volume of <b>a hundred</b> ritual baths, and <b>one hundred and fifty</b> cubic cubits is the volume of another <b>fifty</b> ritual baths. Consequently, <b>four hundred and fifty</b> cubic cubits <b>are enough</b> to contain a hundred and fifty ritual baths; but the volume of the sea was five hundred.<br>The Gemara answers that there is an error in the calculation: <b>These</b> calculations with regard to the volume of the sea would <b>apply to a square,</b> but the <b>sea fashioned by Solomon was round,</b> and its volume was therefore smaller.<br>The Gemara continues to ask: <b>Now, how much larger is a square</b> of ten-by-ten cubits <b>than a circle</b> with a diameter of ten cubits? <b>A quarter.</b> Consequently, <b>four hundred</b> cubic cubits of our original calculation must be reduced to three hundred, which is the volume of <b>one hundred</b> ritual baths; and the remaining <b>hundred</b> cubits must be reduced to seventy-five, which is the volume of <b>twenty-five</b> ritual baths. According to this calculation, Solomon’s Sea was the size of only <b>one hundred and twenty-five</b> ritual baths, not one hundred and fifty as stated above.<br>In answer to this question, <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught</b> as follows: In the <b>sea that Solomon fashioned,</b> the <b>three lower cubits were square and</b> the <b>upper two were round.</b> Consequently, the three lower cubits of the sea contained the volume of a hundred ritual baths, and its upper two cubits contained the volume of fifty ritual baths, for a total of one hundred and fifty ritual baths.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>Although you cannot say the opposite,</b> that the bottom of the sea was round, <b>as it is written</b> in the verse that <b>its brim was round;</b> you can, <b>however, say</b> that only <b>one</b> cubit on top was round.<br>The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>This cannot enter your mind, as it is written</b> with regard to the sea: “And it was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the petals of a lily; <b>it contained two thousand <i>bat</i>”</b> (i Kings 7:26). <b>How much is</b> the measure of <b>a <i>bat</i>? Three <i>se’a</i>,</b> as the verse states: “Concerning the ordinance of oil, the <i>bat</i> of oil, you shall offer <b>the tenth part of a <i>bat</i> out of the <i>kor</i>,</b> which is a <i>ḥomer</i> of ten <i>bat</i>, for ten <i>bat</i> are a <i>ḥomer</i>” (Ezekiel 45:14). This proves that the <i>bat</i> is a tenth of a <i>kor</i>, or three <i>se’a</i>, as a <i>kor</i> is thirty <i>se’a</i>. Consequently, the sea, which contained two thousand <i>bat</i>, <b>contained six thousand <i>se’a</i>,</b> the volume of exactly one hundred and fifty ritual baths.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it written</b> elsewhere with regard to Solomon’s Sea: <b>“It received</b> and held <b>three thousand <i>bat</i>”</b> (ii Chronicles 4:5)? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring <b>to the heaped measure</b> of dry goods that the sea could hold, as dry goods can be heaped above the brim.<br><b>Abaye said: Learn from it</b> that <b>the surplus</b> of dry goods in a vessel relative to liquids <b>is one-third</b> of the contents of the vessel. <b>We also learned</b> the same thing in the following mishna: <b>A carriage, a box, and a cupboard, a round straw barrel, and a round barrel</b> made <b>of reeds, and the cistern of an Alexandrian ship,</b> which is a large vessel placed on a boat and filled with potable water, <b>although</b> these vessels <b>have bottoms,</b> i.e., they are receptacles, since they <b>have a capacity of forty <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>liquid, which is the</b> equivalent of <b>two <i>kor</i></b> of <b>dry</b> goods, they are <b>ritually pure.</b> Even if they come into contact with a source of ritual impurity, they do not become impure. Beyond a certain size, containers are no longer considered vessels and, consequently, cannot become ritually impure. This mishna states clearly that a vessel that holds forty <i>se’a</i> of liquids can hold two <i>kor</i>, or sixty <i>se’a</i>, of dry goods.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The side posts</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> of with regard to rendering an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, <b>their height</b> must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, and their width and thickness</b> may be <b>any amount. Rabbi Yosei says: Their width</b> must be at least <b>three handbreadths.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: <b>The side posts</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> of, <b>etc.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say the mishna taught an unattributed ruling in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that in order to permit carrying in an alleyway, <b>we require</b> two <b>side posts?</b><br>The Gemara responds: <b>No; what</b> is meant by the plural term <b>side posts? Side posts in general,</b> and not those required by a single alleyway. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let</b> the previous mishna <b>also teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a cross <b>beam</b> with the plural term cross <b>beams, and</b> we would say: <b>What</b> is meant by the plural term cross <b>beams?</b> Cross beams <b>in general.</b><br>The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: Those side posts that Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages disagreed about,</b> of which Rabbi Eliezer required two and the Sages sufficed with one, <b>their height</b> must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, and their width and thickness</b> may be <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much is any amount? Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Even as</b> small as <b>the string</b> used to tie <b>a coat.</b><br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>one who erected a side post for half an alleyway,</b> i.e., he put it up halfway down the alleyway rather than at its entrance, <b>he has</b> the right to carry <b>only</b> in the inner <b>half of the alleyway,</b> but not in the outer half. The Gemara asks: <b>That is obvious;</b> what novel element was introduced here? <b>Rather, say: He may</b> carry in the inner <b>half of the alleyway</b> even though there is no side post at the entrance to the alleyway. The Gemara asks: <b>That too is obvious.</b> The Gemara explains that nonetheless there is a novelty here: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we should be concerned that</b> if it is permitted to carry in the inner half <b>one might come to use the entire</b> alleyway, the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches</b> that carrying in the inner half is permitted.<br><b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who erected a side post in an alleyway and raised it three</b> handbreadths <b>from the ground, or distanced it three</b> handbreadths <b>from the wall, he has not done anything,</b> as it is not a valid side post. <b>Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said: We say</b> that objects separated by a gap of up to four handbreadths are considered <b>connected, that applies only above,</b> e.g., to a cross beam that does not reach the wall of the alleyway; <b>but below, since it is a partition through which goats can pass,</b> as a goat can pass through an opening three handbreadths high, even <b>he did not say</b> that they are considered connected.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The width</b> of the side posts must be at least <b>three handbreadths. Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, not with regard to</b> preparing salt <b>brine [<i>hilmei</i>]</b> on Shabbat, <b>and not with regard to side posts.</b><br><b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinana said to him: With regard to brine you told us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, but <b>with regard to side posts you did not tell us</b> this; perhaps you have forgotten that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his view in that case. Rav Yosef asked: <b>What is different about brine,</b> with regard to which <b>the Sages disagree with</b> Rabbi Yosei? In the case of <b>side posts also the Sages disagree with him,</b> and therefore the <i>halakha</i> should not be in accordance with his view in either case. Rav Huna bar Ḥinana <b>said to him: Side posts are different, as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> may be decided in accordance with their jointly held position.<br>The Gemara reports that <b>Rav Raḥumei taught this</b> version of the previous discussion: <b>Rav Yehuda, the son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, not with regard to brine and not with regard to side posts.</b> At some later point, someone <b>said to him: Did you</b> really <b>say</b> this? <b>He said to them: No. Rava said,</b> reinforcing his words with an oath: <b>By God! He did</b> in fact <b>say this, and I learned it from him,</b> but he later retracted this ruling. <b>And what</b> is the <b>reason he retracted it? Due to</b> the well-known principle that <b>Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning [<i>nimmuko</i>] is with him,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> follows his opinion even against the majority view.<br><b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: What is the</b> accepted <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to the width of a side post? <b>He said to him: Go out</b> and observe <b>what the people are doing;</b> it is common practice to rely on a side post of minimal width.<br>The Gemara notes that <b>there are</b> those <b>who taught</b> that <b>this</b> answer was given <b>with regard to this</b> discussion: <b>One who drinks water</b> to quench <b>his thirst recites</b> the following blessing prior to drinking: <b>By Whose word all things came to be. Rabbi Tarfon</b> disagrees and <b>says</b> he recites the blessing: <b>Who creates the many forms of life and their needs, for all that You have created. Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: What is the <i>halakha</i>? He said to him: Go out</b> and observe <b>what the people are doing;</b> the customary practice is to say: By Whose word all things came to be.<br><br></body></html>
