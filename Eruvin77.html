Daf 77a<br><br><b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: These</b> residents of one courtyard <b>may raise</b> food <b>from</b> their courtyard to the top of the wall <b>and eat</b> it there, and they may lower the food from the wall to the courtyard; <b>and those</b> residents of the other courtyard <b>may raise</b> food <b>from</b> their courtyard <b>and eat</b> it there, and they may lower the food from the wall to the courtyard. This is because the wall is considered nonexistent, and its domain is viewed as part of the two courtyards.<br><b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If there was produce on top of the wall, <b>these</b> residents of one courtyard <b>may ascend from this side and eat</b> from it, <b>and those</b> residents of the other courtyard <b>may ascend from that side and eat</b> from it. The Gemara infers from this: To <b>ascend, yes,</b> it is permitted, but to <b>raise</b> food from the courtyard to the top of the wall, <b>no,</b> it is not permitted. This presents a challenge to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion.<br>The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If the top of the wall between the two courtyards <b>is four by four</b> handbreadths, then to <b>ascend, yes,</b> it is permitted. However, to <b>raise</b> food, <b>no,</b> it is prohibited, because in that case the top of the wall is considered a domain in its own right. But if <b>it is not four by four</b> handbreadths, it is an exempt domain, and therefore <b>they may raise</b> their food onto the wall <b>as well.</b><br><b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan followed his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>a place that does not have</b> an area of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths and is situated between a public and a private domain, <b>it is permissible for</b> both <b>the people in the public domain and for the people in the private domain to</b> adjust the burden on their <b>shoulders upon it, provided they do not exchange</b> objects between them from one domain to the other domain. This demonstrates that in the case of an exempt domain, Rabbi Yoḥanan was not concerned that one might carry from one domain to another, and permitted members of both domains to use it.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rav,</b> who prohibits carrying in that case even as much as a hair’s breadth, <b>not accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Dimi</b> in this matter? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this referred <b>to</b> an exempt domain situated between two <b>domains by Torah law,</b> i.e., between a public and a private domain, <b>so too,</b> Rav would agree that the members of both domains may adjust their burdens there.<br>However, <b>with what are we dealing here,</b> in the case of the wall? We are dealing <b>with domains by rabbinic law, and the Sages reinforced their statements</b> even <b>more than those of the Torah.</b> Due to their severity, Torah laws are generally observed. Therefore, there is no need to impose decrees and enactments in order to preserve them. The same is not true of rabbinic decrees; if people ignore the preventive measures, they might come to violate the entire enactment.<br><b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> With regard to <b>a wall that is between two courtyards,</b> and <b>one side</b> facing one courtyard is <b>ten handbreadths high, and the other side is level with the ground</b> of the second courtyard, i.e., the second courtyard is built on a higher plane, so that the wall is less than ten handbreadths above its floor, in this case the Sages <b>grant</b> the use of the top of the wall on Shabbat only <b>to the</b> courtyard in which the wall is <b>level with the ground.</b><br>The reason is <b>because the use of</b> the wall <b>is convenient for one</b> side, i.e., the higher courtyard, <b>but difficult for the other</b> side. The wall can be used more conveniently by the residents of the higher courtyard. <b>And</b> the principle is that in <b>any</b> case with regard to Shabbat where an action is <b>convenient for one</b> party <b>and difficult for another,</b> the Sages <b>grant it to the one for whom its use is convenient.</b><br>Similarly, <b>Rav Sheizvi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> In the case of <b>a ditch between two courtyards, one side of which is ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep, and the other side of which is level with the ground</b> of the second courtyard, i.e., is less than ten handbreadths below it, the Sages <b>grant</b> the use of the ditch <b>to the</b> courtyard in which the ditch is <b>level with the ground.</b> This is <b>because it is</b> a case in which <b>the use of</b> the ditch <b>is convenient for one</b> side, where it is close to level with the ground, <b>and difficult for the other,</b> where the ditch is ten handbreadths deep, and whenever use of an item is convenient for one party and inconvenient for another, it is granted to the one for whom it is convenient.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to cite both of these cases, as it would not have been possible to learn one from the other, <b>since, had</b> Rav Naḥman <b>taught us</b> only the case <b>with regard to a wall,</b> one could have said that the <i>halakha</i> applies only in that case, <b>because people use an elevated</b> surface. Even for the residents of the lower courtyard, it is relatively easy to use this wall. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a ditch, people do not use a deep</b> surface, as it is troublesome to bend down and place an item in a ditch. In that case, one might <b>say</b> that it may <b>not</b> be used by the residents of either courtyard.<br><b>And</b> likewise, <b>had he taught us</b> only the case <b>with regard to a ditch,</b> one could have said that the <i>halakha</i> applies only in that case, <b>because its use does not cause worry,</b> as anything placed in the ditch is protected. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a wall, the use of which causes worry</b> that the objects placed there are liable to fall, one might <b>say</b> that it may <b>not</b> be used by the residents of either courtyard. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to state both of these rulings.<br>With regard to a wall between two courtyards, the Gemara states: If <b>one comes to diminish</b> the height of the wall by placing a stone next to it, or by building a platform in order to permit its use or to utilize it as a passageway to another courtyard, the following distinction applies: <b>If the diminished</b> section <b>is</b> at least <b>four handbreadths</b> wide, <b>it is permitted to use the entire wall.</b> This area has the status of an entrance and the two courtyards are considered one, which renders the entire wall permitted. <b>However, if</b> the diminished section is <b>not</b> at least four handbreadths wide, <b>one</b> may <b>use only the</b> area of the wall <b>opposite</b> the <b>diminished</b> section, but no more.<br>The Gemara challenges this ruling: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this ruling is difficult. <b>If the diminishing was effective, although</b> it extends less than four handbreadths, <b>let him use</b> the entire <b>wall;</b> and <b>if</b> the diminishing <b>was not effective, even</b> the area <b>corresponding to the diminished</b> section should <b>also not</b> be permitted for use, as this section is insignificant. <b>Ravina said:</b> Here, it refers to a case <b>where one removed a segment</b> of stone <b>from the top</b> of the wall. Since the wall is actually less than ten handbreadths high along that section, it is fit for use as is an opening in the wall.<br><b>Rav Yeḥiel said:</b> If <b>one overturned a basin</b> and placed it next to a wall, such that the wall is no longer ten handbreadths high, <b>it</b> effectively <b>diminishes</b> the height of the wall.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> should this be so? Isn’t this basin <b>an item that may be moved on Shabbat,</b> i.e., something that one is permitted to handle? <b>And</b> the principle is that <b>an item that may be moved on Shabbat does not diminish</b> a wall. Since it can be removed at any moment on Shabbat, such an object cannot be viewed as a permanent part of the wall. The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is necessary;</b> this basin can be considered a permanent part of the wall in a case <b>where he attached</b> the basin <b>to the ground</b> by covering it with soil. The basin may then not be moved on Shabbat due to the prohibition of handling soil.<br>The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And if one attached</b> the basin <b>to the ground, what of it? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an unripe</b> fig <b>that one buried in straw</b> intended for kindling, so that it would ripen, <b>or a cake that one buried in coals</b> before Shabbat, and the coals were extinguished, <b>if part of</b> either one <b>is visible, it may be moved on Shabbat.</b> This is not prohibited, although as a result one will move the straw or the coals, which are set aside.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case where the top of the basin <b>has a rim</b> that is fully buried in the ground, so that removing the basin will dislodge the earth under which it is buried in a manner similar to digging, which is prohibited on Shabbat.<br>The Gemara further challenges this explanation: <b>And if</b> the basin <b>has a rim, what of it? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who buries a turnip or a radish</b> in the ground <b>beneath a vine</b> for safekeeping, <b>when</b><br><br>Daf 77b<br><br><b>some of the leaves</b> of the turnip or radish <b>are showing, he need not be concerned due to diverse kinds,</b> i.e., that he violated the prohibition of planting food crops in a vineyard, as he did not intend to commit an act of planting; <b>nor due to tithes,</b> i.e., there is no concern lest the turnip or radish grew further, in which case he would be obligated to tithe it; <b>nor due to</b> the prohibition against working the land during <b>the Sabbatical Year,</b> and similarly, he need not be concerned that they grew further and that the additional growth is prohibited as produce that grew during the Sabbatical Year. <b>And</b> therefore, the turnip or radish <b>may be taken</b> from the ground <b>on Shabbat.</b> Even if most of the turnip or radish is underground, it is permitted to pull it from the ground on Shabbat. If so, in the case described in the mishna here, even if the basin buried in the ground has a rim, it should nevertheless be permitted to move it.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Yeḥiel’s ruling <b>is necessary</b> in a case where the basin was so firmly attached to the ground <b>that one would need a hoe [<i>mara</i>] or a spade</b> to remove it, as this action would certainly involve digging, which is prohibited on Shabbat. Therefore, since the basin cannot be removed on Shabbat, it is considered fixed in its place and effectively diminishes the height of the wall.<br>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An Egyptian ladder,</b> which is small, <b>does not diminish</b> the height of a wall, whereas <b>a</b> larger, <b>Tyrian</b> ladder effectively <b>diminishes</b> its height. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of an <b>Egyptian ladder;</b> i.e., what characterizes it? <b>The</b> scholars of the <b>school of Rabbi Yannai said: Any</b> ladder <b>that does not have four rungs.</b><br><b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is the reason</b> that <b>an Egyptian ladder does not diminish</b> the height of a wall? He <b>said to him: Did you not hear</b> that which <b>Rav Aḥa bar Adda said</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>because it is an object that may be moved on Shabbat,</b> i.e., it is not set-aside [<i>muktze</i>], <b>and</b> the principle is that <b>any object that may be moved on Shabbat does not diminish</b> the height of a wall, as it cannot be considered a permanent part of the wall.<br>The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> this should apply <b>even</b> to <b>a Tyrian</b> ladder <b>as well,</b> as a large ladder is also not set-aside and may be handled on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a Tyrian ladder, <b>its heaviness establishes it</b> as part of the wall. Even though one is permitted to move it, since due to its weight it is not moved easily, it effectively diminishes the height of the wall.<br><b>Abaye said:</b> If <b>a wall between two courtyards</b> is <b>ten handbreadths high, and one placed a ladder four</b> handbreadths <b>wide</b> against the wall <b>on one side,</b> in one courtyard, <b>and</b> another <b>ladder four</b> handbreadths <b>wide on the other side,</b> in the other courtyard, <b>and there are less than three handbreadths between them,</b> i.e., the two ladders on the opposite sides of the wall are within three handbreadths of each other, even if they are not directly opposite each other, this <b>diminishes</b> the height of the wall. The pair of ladders is regarded as a valid passageway between the two courtyards. However, if the gap between the two ladders is <b>three</b> handbreadths or more, this <b>does not diminish</b> the height of the wall.<br><b>And we only said</b> this qualification if the <b>wall was less than four</b> handbreadths wide. However, <b>if</b> the <b>wall was</b> at least <b>four</b> handbreadths wide, then <b>even</b> if one ladder was <b>greatly distanced</b> from the other, this <b>likewise</b> renders it permitted. Since it is possible to walk along the thickness of the wall, the pair of ladders constitutes a passageway between the two courtyards.<br><b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: If one built a</b> wooden <b>platform</b> next to the wall <b>above</b> another <b>platform,</b> then <b>if the lower platform is four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it diminishes</b> the height of the wall to below ten handbreadths. <b>Alternatively,</b> if <b>the lower</b> one <b>is not four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>but the upper</b> one <b>is four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>and there is</b> a gap of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths <b>between them, it diminishes</b> the height of the wall, as the two platforms are considered as one.<br><b>And Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> In the case of <b>a ladder whose rungs are disconnected, if the bottom rung is four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it diminishes</b> the height of the wall. <b>Alternatively,</b> if <b>the bottom rung is not four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>but the upper rung is four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>and there is</b> a gap of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths <b>between them, it diminishes</b> the height of the wall, because the principle of <i>lavud</i> joins the two rungs together.<br><b>And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said:</b><br><br></body></html>
