Daf 95a<br><br><b>A</b> cross <b>beam four</b> handbreadths wide <b>renders</b> carrying <b>in a ruin</b> that is breached into a public domain <b>permitted,</b> as the edge of the cross beam is considered to descend and seal the breach. <b>And</b> that which <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: A</b> cross <b>beam four</b> handbreadths wide <b>renders</b> carrying <b>in water permitted</b> like a partition. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion were these rulings stated?<br>The Gemara explains: <b>According to this version that you stated,</b> that Rav and Shmuel <b>agree with regard to</b> an opening no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits, here it is referring <b>to</b> a cross beam that is no longer than <b>ten</b> cubits, <b>and everyone,</b> both Rav and Shmuel, <b>agrees</b> with these rulings. <b>According to that</b> other <b>version that you stated,</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> an opening no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits, these rulings are <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> alone.<br>The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava are disagreeing with regard to the</b> point that was the subject of a <b>dispute between Rav and Shmuel. As it was stated:</b> If one <b>placed roofing on top of a portico that has doorposts,</b> i.e., pillars that form the beginnings of partitions, <b>it is a valid <i>sukka</i>.</b> If, however, he placed the roofing atop a portico that <b>has no doorposts,</b> there is a dispute. <b>Abaye said: It is a valid <i>sukka</i>. And Rava said: It is invalid.</b><br>The Gemara elaborates: <b>Abaye said: It is valid.</b> As <b>he said: The edge of a roof descends and seals.</b> Since the portico is roofed, it is considered to have partitions as well. <b>And Rava said: It is invalid,</b> as <b>he did not say: The edge of a roof descends and seals. Let us say</b> that <b>Abaye</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, and Rava</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, everyone,</b> including Abaye, <b>agrees</b> that this <i>sukka</i> is invalid. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav. Abaye</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> in a straightforward manner. <b>And Rava</b> claims: <b>Rav stated</b> his opinion, that the edge of the portico descends and seals, <b>only there, where those partitions</b> formed by the roof <b>were built for the portico,</b> and they are therefore viewed as sealing it. <b>However, here, where these partitions were not built for</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>, no,</b> even Rav would agree that the partitions are not sufficiently significant to utilize for the purpose of this mitzva.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If they are permitted</b> to carry there on that Shabbat, they are likewise permitted to do so in the future, and if they are prohibited from carrying there in the future, they are also prohibited from carrying there on that Shabbat <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> intend <b>to prohibit</b> carrying even on that Shabbat, <b>or to permit</b> carrying even in the future?<br><b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> His intention was <b>to prohibit</b> carrying even on that Shabbat. <b>And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> His intention was <b>to prohibit</b> carrying even on that Shabbat. <b>This</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Just as they are prohibited</b> from carrying <b>in the future, so are they prohibited</b> from carrying <b>on that Shabbat.</b><br><b>It was stated: Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, while Shmuel said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br>The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>But did Shmuel</b> really <b>say this? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established for a person only with his knowledge, <b>stated?</b> It is <b>with regard to a joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries, but with regard to a joining of courtyards, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for another person <b>both with his knowledge and without his knowledge, because one may act in a person’s interest</b> even when <b>not in his presence, but one may act to</b> his <b>disadvantage only in his presence.</b> One may take unilateral action on another’s behalf when it is to that other person’s benefit. However, if it is to that person’s disadvantage, or when the action entails both benefits and disadvantages, he may act on the other person’s behalf only if he was explicitly appointed as his agent. A joining of courtyards is always to a person’s benefit, and therefore it can be established even without his knowledge. However, with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries, any distance that a person gains in one direction he forfeits in the opposite direction. Consequently, this type of <i>eiruv</i> may be established only with his knowledge.<br><b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And furthermore, anyplace where Rabbi Yehuda taught with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i>, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his</b> opinion.<br><b>And Rav Ḥana of Baghdad said to Rav Yehuda:</b> Did <b>Shmuel state</b> this ruling <b>even with regard to an alleyway whose</b> cross <b>beam or side post was removed</b> during Shabbat? <b>And</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: I spoke to you with regard to</b> the acquisition of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, and not with regard to partitions.</b> The Gemara asks: How, then, could Shmuel rule that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in this case, after explicitly stating that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion in the case of fallen partitions?<br><b>Rav Anan said:</b> This matter <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Shmuel</b> himself: <b>Here,</b> where Shmuel rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it is in a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>was breached into a <i>karmelit</i>.</b> In that case the <i>halakha</i> is lenient, as there is no concern lest one transgress a Torah prohibition. <b>There,</b> where Shmuel states that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it is in a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>was breached into a public domain,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is therefore stringent, due to the concern lest one transgress a Torah prohibition.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who builds an upper story atop two houses</b> on opposite sides of a public domain that passes beneath it, <b>and likewise bridges with a thoroughfare</b> beneath them that rest on walls on opposite sides of a public domain, <b>one</b> may <b>carry beneath</b> the upper story and beneath the bridge <b>on Shabbat.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that these areas are considered private domains. <b>And the Rabbis prohibit</b> carrying in these areas.<br><b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> even <b>for an alleyway that is open</b> at both ends, with no need for any additional measures, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> doing so.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba said: Do not say this is Rabbi Yehuda’s reason; that he maintains</b> that <b>by Torah law two partitions</b> constitute a private domain, i.e., the areas beneath the upper story and the bridge are considered private domains, as each has two partitions, one on each side of the public domain. Rather, the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is <b>because he maintains</b> that <b>the edge of a roof descends and seals.</b> The edges of the upper story and the bridge are considered to seal the areas beneath them.<br><b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> With regard to <b>one who has two houses on two sides of a public domain</b> and seeks to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <b>he places a side post from here,</b> adjacent to one of the houses, <b>and</b> another <b>side post from there,</b> adjacent to the other house, <b>or</b> he places <b>a</b> cross <b>beam from here and</b> another cross <b>beam from there, and he may</b> subsequently <b>carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in the middle</b> of the area, as he transformed it into a private domain. His colleagues <b>said to him: One cannot establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> to transform a <b>public domain</b> into a private domain <b>in this manner.</b> Clearly, the rationale for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion in that case is not that the edge of the roof descends and seals, as the area is not covered. Rather, he apparently holds that by Torah law, two walls suffice to form a private domain.<br>Rabba <b>said to him: From that</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>yes,</b> it is indeed possible to arrive at this conclusion. But <b>from this,</b> the mishna, <b>nothing can be learned from this</b> source, as there could be a different reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion.<br><b>Rav Ashi said: The mishna is also precise</b> in its wording, as it indicates that the rationale for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is that the edge of a roof descends and seals. <b>As</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> even <b>for an alleyway that is open</b> at both ends, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> doing so.<br><b>Granted, if you say</b> that the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s leniency with regard to carrying beneath an upper story and a bridge is <b>that he maintains</b> that <b>the edge of a roof descends and seals, that is</b> why the mishna <b>states: And furthermore,</b> to introduce the ruling for an alleyway. In other words, the <i>tanna</i> of our mishna is saying that the ruling applies not only to a roofed area, but also to an unroofed alleyway, despite the fact that the reason there is that two partitions suffice to create a private domain by Torah law.<br><b>However, if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda permitted the first case as well <b>because he maintains</b> that <b>by Torah law two partitions</b> suffice to create a private domain, <b>what</b> is the need for the introduction: <b>And furthermore?</b> The rationale for the second ruling is no different from the rationale for the first. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is correct.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who finds phylacteries</b> outside the city on Shabbat, where they are in danger of becoming lost or damaged, <b>brings them in</b> to his house <b>pair</b> by <b>pair</b> by donning them in the manner in which they are typically donned for the mitzva. <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> He brings them in <b>two</b> pairs by <b>two</b> pairs. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to old</b> phylacteries, which have already been used and are designated for the mitzva. <b>However, with regard to new</b> ones, as it is unclear whether they are phylacteries or merely amulets in the form of phylacteries, he is <b>exempt</b> from performing the task.<br>If <b>one finds</b> phylacteries <b>tied in bundles or in wrapped piles,</b> in which case he is unable to carry them in pairs, <b>he</b> sits there and <b>waits with them until dark,</b> guarding them until the conclusion of Shabbat, <b>and</b> then <b>brings them in</b> to his house.<br><br>Daf 95b<br><br><b>And in</b> a time of <b>danger,</b> when it is dangerous to tarry outside town, <b>he covers</b> the phylacteries <b>and proceeds on his</b> way.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that there is an alternative method of transferring the phylacteries: <b>One gives them to another</b> who is less than four cubits from him, <b>and the other</b> passes them <b>to another, until</b> the phylacteries <b>reach the outermost courtyard</b> of the city. Since carrying less than four cubits in a public domain is not prohibited by Torah law, in this case, the Sages permitted carrying in that manner due to the sanctity of the phylacteries.<br><b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one’s son</b> who was born in a field and may not be carried on Shabbat, since that is akin to carrying a burden in the public domain: <b>One gives him to another, and the other</b> passes him <b>to another, even</b> if it requires <b>a hundred</b> people. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> may even <b>give a barrel to another, and the other</b> may pass it <b>to another,</b> and in that way <b>even</b> take it <b>beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> provided that no one person carries it more than four cubits. <b>They said to him: This</b> barrel may <b>not go a greater</b> distance <b>than the feet of its owner,</b> i.e., it may not be carried any farther than its owner may walk.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that a person who finds phylacteries in a field may carry them by pairs, indicating that <b>one pair, yes,</b> it may be carried; however, <b>more</b> than one pair, <b>no,</b> they may not be carried. The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>we learned the unattributed</b> mishna <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> despite the principle that an unattributed mishna usually reflects Rabbi Meir’s opinion.<br><b>As, if</b> you say that the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, didn’t</b> Rabbi Meir <b>say:</b> In order to rescue items from a fire, one is permitted to remove items from his house by wearing them, and <b>he dons all</b> the clothes <b>that he can wear, and wraps</b> himself <b>in all</b> items in <b>which he can wrap</b> himself. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>And one removes all the utensils to</b> the courtyard adjacent to the fire, <b>and dons all</b> the garments <b>that he can wear, and wraps</b> himself in <b>all</b> the items in <b>which he can wrap</b> himself in order to rescue his property.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> do we know that <b>this unattributed</b> mishna with regard to Shabbat <b>is</b> a reflection of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir? As it teaches with regard to</b> that mishna: If there are many garments there, one <b>dons</b> garments, and <b>takes</b> them <b>out</b> to a safe place, <b>and removes</b> them there, <b>and returns</b> to the fire, <b>and dons</b> other garments, <b>and takes</b> them <b>out and removes</b> them. <b>And</b> he may do so <b>even all day long;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Apparently, according to Rabbi Meir, one may don many garments at once.<br>In answer to the question, <b>Rava said: Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> there is a distinction between the cases. <b>There,</b> if he dons the clothes in <b>the manner that he</b> typically <b>wears them, the Sages rendered</b> the legal status of wearing garments on Shabbat <b>like</b> the status of wearing garments during the <b>week</b> and permitted him to remove clothes from his house by wearing them in that manner. <b>And here,</b> too, if he dons phylacteries in <b>the manner that he</b> typically <b>dons them, the Sages rendered</b> the legal status of donning phylacteries on Shabbat <b>like</b> the status of donning phylacteries during the <b>week.</b><br>Consequently, <b>there, where during the week he</b> may <b>wear as many</b> clothes <b>as he wishes, with regard to rescue</b> from a fire <b>the Sages likewise permitted him</b> to wear as many clothes as he wishes. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of phylacteries, <b>even during the week,</b> donning <b>one pair, yes,</b> one may do so, but donning <b>more</b> than one pair, <b>no,</b> he may not do so. Therefore, <b>with regard to rescue as well,</b> the Sages said: Donning <b>one pair, yes,</b> one may do so; however, donning <b>more</b> than one pair, <b>no,</b> he may not.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> He brings the phylacteries in <b>two</b> pairs <b>by two</b> pairs. The Gemara asks: <b>What does he hold?</b> What is the rationale for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If he holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is a time for phylacteries,</b> and one is permitted or even obligated to don phylacteries on Shabbat, then the ruling should be: Donning <b>one pair, yes,</b> this is permitted; donning <b>more, no,</b> it is prohibited. It should be prohibited to wear more than one pair as there is room to don only one set of phylacteries on one’s head.<br><b>And if he holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries, and</b> it was only <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>rescue</b> was permitted only in the <b>manner</b> that one typically wears <b>clothing</b> that <b>the Sages permitted him</b> to don phylacteries, he should <b>likewise</b> be permitted to don <b>even more</b> than two pairs. He should be permitted to don as many pairs of phylacteries as possible, not only two.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries, and when the Sages permitted</b> one to don phylacteries <b>for the purpose of rescue,</b> it was only by donning them in the <b>manner</b> that one typically wears <b>clothing,</b> i.e., in the appropriate <b>place</b> for <b>phylacteries.</b> He may not don them anywhere else on his body, as in that case he is considered to be carrying, not wearing them.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> then <b>one pair, yes,</b> it should be permitted, but <b>more, no,</b> it should not be permitted, as the second pair is necessarily positioned out of place. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: There is room on</b> one’s <b>head to place two phylacteries.</b> One can place two phylacteries on his head and don them both in the proper manner.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>It works out well</b> with regard to donning two phylacteries <b>of the head,</b> as there is room; however, with regard to the phylacteries <b>of the arm, what is there to say?</b> How can one wear two phylacteries on his arm simultaneously?<br>The Gemara answers that even when one dons two phylacteries on his arm, he is regarded as donning them in the typical manner, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna. As Rav Huna said: Sometimes a person comes from the field with his bundle on his head,</b> and in order not to crush the phylacteries, he <b>removes them from his head and binds them on his arm.</b> This indicates that there is room for additional phylacteries on his arm.<br>The Gemara rejects this: <b>Say that Rav Huna said</b> that one may remove the phylacteries from his head and tie them on his arm <b>so that he will not</b> come to <b>treat</b> them <b>in a degrading manner</b> by placing a bundle on top of them. However, <b>did he say</b> that the spot on his arm is <b>fit</b> for two phylacteries? Can proof be cited from here that one may don additional phylacteries on his arm <i>ab initio</i>?<br><b>Rather,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: There is room on</b> one’s <b>head to place two phylacteries. Here, too, there is room on the arm to place two phylacteries.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>The school of Menashe taught</b> the following. The verse states: “And you shall bind them for a sign on your arm, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8). <b>“On your arm,” this is the biceps</b> muscle of the arm; <b>“between your eyes,” this is the crown</b> of the head. The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> exactly on the crown of the head? <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> Phylacteries are placed on <b>the spot where a baby’s head is soft</b> after birth.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna <b>disagree about</b> the principle of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak,</b> such <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> is not</b> of the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak</b> that there is room on one’s head for two phylacteries, <b>while Rabban Gamliel is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak,</b> and therefore one is permitted to bring in two pairs of phylacteries at a time.<br>The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone is</b> of the opinion of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>Shabbat is a time for phylacteries. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is a time for phylacteries.</b> Although one may don one pair of phylacteries, he may not add to the mitzva by donning an extra pair. If he does so, it is tantamount to carrying a prohibited burden.<br><b>And Rabban Gamliel holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries.</b> Consequently, one may don more than one pair, as the day itself is not at all suitable for donning phylacteries. When he dons the second pair, he is not adding to the mitzva. With regard to rescuing them, the phylacteries have the legal status of an ornament that he is permitted to don, provided that he dons no more than two pairs.<br><b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the dispute should be understood as follows. <b>Everyone agrees that Shabbat is a time for phylacteries, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not fulfillment of <b>mitzvot requires intent. The first <i>tanna</i> holds: To fulfill</b> a mitzva one <b>needs intent.</b> Therefore, if one dons phylacteries without intent to fulfill the mitzva, no mitzva is performed, and he is merely carrying a burden. However, if he has intent to fulfill the mitzva, he may don no more than one pair. If he does so, he violates the prohibition against adding to mitzvot.<br><b>And Rabban Gamliel holds:</b> In order to fulfill a mitzva, <b>one does not need intent.</b> Therefore, if one dons two pairs of phylacteries he fulfills his obligation with one of them, but does not violate the prohibition against adding to mitzvot with the other. In order to do so, he would require specific intent to fulfill a second mitzva with the additional pair.<br><br></body></html>
