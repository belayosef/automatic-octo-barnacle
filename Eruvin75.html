Daf 75a<br><br><b>I would have said</b> that <b>the residence of a gentile is considered a residence</b> with regard to defining an area as an alleyway. Therefore, he <b>teaches us that the</b> legal <b>status of the residence of a gentile is not considered a</b> full-fledged <b>residence</b> in this regard. <b>And if</b> Rav had taught this <i>halakha</i> only <b>from</b> the ruling <b>here,</b> with regard to gentiles, <b>I would have said</b> that <b>I do not know how many houses there</b> are. Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that there must be at least <b>two houses</b> and two courtyards.<br><b>Now that Rav</b> has <b>said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to <b>a courtyard,</b> this implies that <b>the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav is that he holds: It is prohibited for an individual to establish</b> his home <b>in the place</b> where <b>a gentile</b> resides. Consequently, he is prohibited from establishing an <i>eiruv</i>, so that the difficulties of living there will force him to move.<br><b>Rav Yosef said: If so, this is</b> why <b>I heard Rabbi Tavla say: A gentile, a gentile, two times</b> while teaching this subject, even though <b>I did not understand</b> then <b>what he</b> meant to <b>say.</b> Now I realize that he was speaking about both an alleyway and a courtyard.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>two courtyards, one</b> of which was <b>within the other,</b> and the outer one opened into the public domain, the following distinctions apply: If <b>the inner</b> courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> for itself <b>and the outer</b> one <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> carrying in <b>the inner one is permitted and</b> carrying in <b>the outer one is prohibited.</b><br>If <b>the outer</b> courtyard established an <i>eiruv</i> <b>and the inner</b> one did <b>not,</b> carrying in <b>both</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> as the residents of the inner courtyard pass through the outer one, and are considered to a certain extent as residents of the courtyard who did not participate in the <i>eiruv</i>. If <b>this</b> courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> for itself, and that</b> courtyard also <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> for itself,</b> but they did not establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> with one another, <b>this one is permitted by itself, and that one is permitted by itself,</b> but they may not carry from one to the other.<br><b>Rabbi Akiva prohibits</b> carrying in <b>the outer one</b> even in such a case, <b>as the</b> right of <b>entry</b> to the outer courtyard enjoyed by the residents of the inner courtyard <b>renders it prohibited. And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say:</b> The right of <b>entry</b> enjoyed by the residents of the inner courtyard <b>does not render it prohibited.</b> Since the residents of the inner courtyard do not use the outer one other than to pass through it, and they are permitted to carry in their own courtyard, they do not render it prohibited to carry in the outer courtyard.<br>If <b>one</b> resident <b>of the outer</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> carrying in <b>the inner</b> courtyard <b>is permitted and</b> in <b>the outer one is prohibited.</b> If one resident <b>of the inner</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>, they are both prohibited,</b> as the right of way enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard through the outer courtyard renders the outer one prohibited as well.<br>If the residents of both courtyards <b>put their <i>eiruv</i> in one place, and one</b> person, <b>whether</b> he was <b>from the inner</b> courtyard <b>or from the outer one, forgot and did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>, they are both prohibited</b> for carrying within them, as the two courtyards are treated as one. <b>And if</b> the courtyards belonged <b>to individuals,</b> i.e., if only one person lived in each courtyard, <b>they are not required to establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> as this requirement applies only to a courtyard occupied by multiple residents.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yannai: This</b> mishna, which states that if the residents of the outer courtyard established an <i>eiruv</i> but the residents of the inner one did not, they are both prohibited from carrying, is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva, who said: Even</b> the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted in its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., even someone from a courtyard in which he is permitted to carry, <b>renders</b> it <b>prohibited when</b> he is <b>not in its</b> own <b>place.</b> If he enjoys the right of entry to another courtyard he is considered like a resident of that courtyard as well, and if he does not participate in the <i>eiruv</i>, no one in that courtyard may carry. <b>However, the Rabbis say: Just as</b> the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted</b> in its own place <b>does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry in another courtyard, <b>so</b> too, the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is prohibited</b> in his place <b>does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry in another courtyard. Consequently, if only the residents of the outer courtyard established an <i>eiruv</i>, the residents of the inner one do not render it prohibited to carry in the outer courtyard.<br><b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If the residents of <b>the outer</b> courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> and</b> the residents of <b>the inner</b> courtyard did <b>not, they are both prohibited. Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If you say</b> it is that of <b>Rabbi Akiva, why</b> discuss <b>particularly</b> the case of <b>a foot that is prohibited,</b> i.e., a case where the inner courtyard did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>? According to Rabbi Akiva, <b>even a foot that is permitted also</b> renders it prohibited to carry. Therefore, even if the residents of the inner courtyard had established an <i>eiruv</i>, they would still render it prohibited to carry in the outer courtyard. <b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b> This would indicate that the Rabbis agree that one who may not carry in his own courtyard does, in fact, render it prohibited to carry in a different courtyard through which he has right of entry, contrary to Rabbi Yannai’s claim.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Actually,</b> this part of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and <b>he teaches</b> the mishna employing the style: <b>Not</b> only <b>this</b> but <b>also that.</b> In other words, he begins by teaching the <i>halakha</i> in a relatively straightforward case and then proceeds to a more complicated example. Consequently, the mishna should be understood as follows: Not only is it prohibited to carry in both courtyards if the residents of the outer courtyard established an <i>eiruv</i> and the residents of the inner one did not, but even if the residents of both courtyards established separate <i>eiruvin</i>, it remains prohibited to carry in the outer one.<br>The Gemara continues: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>this</b> courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> for itself, and that</b> courtyard also <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> for itself,</b> but the two courtyards did not establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> with one another, <b>this one is permitted by itself, and that one is permitted by itself,</b> but it is prohibited to carry from one courtyard to the other. <b>The reason</b> both courtyards are permitted by themselves is that the residents of the inner courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> By inference, if they <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> carrying in <b>both would be prohibited.</b><br><b>But this <i>tanna</i>, who said</b> that the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted</b> in his own place <b>does not</b> render it <b>prohibited</b> to carry, while the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is prohibited</b> in its own place <b>does</b> render it <b>prohibited</b> to carry, <b>who is this</b> <i>tanna</i>? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> there is a difficulty, as he holds that <b>even</b> the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted</b> in its own place <b>also</b> renders it prohibited to carry in a different place. <b>Rather, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> which indicates that the Rabbis agree that the foot of one who is prohibited in its own place does, in fact, render it prohibited to carry in a different place, in contrast to the statement of Rabbi Yannai? <b>And furthermore, from the fact that the latter clause</b> that follows immediately states the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it is clear that <b>the first clause,</b> with which Rabbi Akiva disagrees, <b>is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b><br>The Gemara responds: The <b>entire</b> mishna in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and it is incomplete and teaches the following:</b> If <b>this</b> courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> for itself, and that</b> courtyard also <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> for itself,</b> but they did not establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> with one another, <b>this one is permitted by itself, and that one is permitted by itself,</b> but they may not carry from one to the other. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>where</b> the inner courtyard <b>constructed a</b> small <b>partition</b> at its entrance. <b>However,</b> if <b>it did not construct a partition, the outer</b> courtyard <b>is prohibited.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva, as Rabbi Akiva prohibits</b> carrying in <b>the outer</b> courtyard <b>because the</b> right of <b>entry</b> enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard <b>renders</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry. <b>And the Rabbis say: The</b> right of <b>entry</b> enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard <b>does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry.<br><b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye raised an objection</b> based upon the final clause of the mishna: <b>And if</b> the courtyards belonged <b>to individuals,</b> i.e., if only one person lived in each courtyard, <b>they are not required to establish an <i>eiruv</i>. Doesn’t</b> this indicate that if they belong <b>to many</b> people jointly, <b>they need to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? Apparently,</b> the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted in his</b> own <b>place does not render</b> it <b>prohibited,</b> but the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is prohibited</b> in his own place does <b>render</b> it <b>prohibited.</b> This contradicts Rabbi Yannai’s understanding of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion.<br><b>And Ravina raised a further objection</b> from the mishna: If <b>one</b> resident <b>of the outer</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>, the inner</b> courtyard <b>is permitted</b> for carrying <b>and the outer one is prohibited.</b> If <b>one</b> resident <b>of the inner</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>, both</b> courtyards <b>are prohibited,</b> as the right of way enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard through the outer courtyard renders the outer one prohibited as well. <b>The reason is that</b> one of the residents <b>forgot</b> to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>. <b>But</b> if <b>he did not forget,</b> and each courtyard established its own valid <i>eiruv</i>, <b>both of them</b> would be <b>permitted. Apparently,</b> the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted in his</b> own <b>place does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry, but the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is prohibited</b> in his own place does <b>render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry. This cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, as he holds that even the foot of one who is permitted in his own place renders it prohibited to carry elsewhere. Rather, it must be the opinion of the Rabbis, which proves that even they agree that the foot of one who is prohibited in his own place does render a different courtyard prohibited.<br><b>Rather,</b> this version must be rejected, and <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he cited a different version. <b>Rabbi Yannai said: There are three disputes with regard to</b> this <b>matter. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted in his</b> own <b>place does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry elsewhere, but the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is prohibited</b> in his own place does <b>render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry. <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>even</b> the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted</b> in his own place <b>renders</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry in a different place. <b>And the latter Rabbis hold</b> that <b>just as</b> the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is permitted in his</b> own <b>place does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry, <b>so</b> too, the <b>foot</b> of one <b>who is prohibited does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry. This explanation resolves all of the difficulties posed earlier.<br>It was stated in the mishna: If the residents of both courtyards <b>put their <i>eiruv</i> in one place, and one</b> person, <b>whether</b> he was <b>from the inner</b> courtyard or from the outer one, <b>forgot</b> and did not contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>, it is prohibited to carry in both courtyards. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>one place?</b> Is the <i>halakha</i> different if the two courtyards established their <i>eiruv</i> in one place or in different places?<br>Before continuing, the Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing discussion: <b>Outer; for itself; in the house of an individual; Ravina; where the inner one did not forget.</b><br><b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case when the residents of both courtyards established their <i>eiruv</i> in <b>the outer</b> courtyard. <b>And why did they call it one</b> [<b><i>eḥad</i></b>] <b>place?</b> Because it is a place that is <b>designated</b> [<b><i>meyuḥad</i></b>] <b>for</b> the residents of <b>both</b> courtyards, as the members of the inner one also pass through the outer courtyard. Therefore, if a member of the outer courtyard forgot to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>, the inner courtyard is also prohibited. Since the <i>eiruv</i> of the inner courtyard is located in the outer courtyard, the residents of the inner courtyard cannot separate themselves from the outer one. However, if the <i>eiruv</i> was deposited in the inner courtyard and a member of the outer courtyard forgot to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>, carrying in the inner courtyard is permitted, because in that situation they can separate themselves from the outer courtyard.<br><br>Daf 75b<br><br><b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>they placed their <i>eiruv</i> in the outer</b> courtyard, <b>and one</b> person <b>forgot</b> to contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>, whether he is</b> a resident <b>of the outer</b> courtyard <b>or of the inner</b> one, <b>they are both prohibited.</b> If <b>they put their <i>eiruv</i> in the inner</b> courtyard, <b>and one</b> resident <b>of the inner</b> courtyard <b>forgot</b> to contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>, they are both prohibited.</b> Similarly, if one of the residents <b>of the outer</b> courtyard <b>did not</b> contribute to the <b><i>eiruv</i>, they are both prohibited.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say: In this</b> case, where the <i>eiruv</i> was deposited in the inner courtyard and the person who forgot to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i> was a resident of the outer one, the <b>inner</b> courtyard <b>is permitted and the outer one is prohibited.</b><br><b>Rabba bar Ḥanan said to Abaye: What is different according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that the <b>inner</b> courtyard <b>is permitted?</b> It is <b>because</b> the residents of the inner courtyard can <b>shut the door</b> of their courtyard to the members of the outer one <b>and use</b> the inner courtyard on their own. But if so, <b>according to Rabbi Akiva as well, let</b> the residents of the inner courtyard <b>shut the door</b> of their courtyard to the members of the outer one <b>and use</b> their courtyard on their own. Abaye <b>said to him:</b> If the <i>eiruv</i> of the outer courtyard was not placed in the inner courtyard, your argument would be valid. But the fact that <b>the <i>eiruv</i></b> is deposited in the inner courtyard <b>accustoms</b> the residents of the outer courtyard to enter it.<br>The Gemara asks: If so, <b>according to the Rabbis as well</b> we should say that the placement of the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> in the inner courtyard <b>accustoms</b> the residents of the outer courtyard to enter it. The Gemara answers: The reasoning of the Rabbis is <b>that</b> the members of the inner courtyard can <b>say</b> to the members of the outer one: <b>We joined with you</b> in a single <i>eiruv</i> <b>to</b> our <b>benefit, and not to</b> our <b>detriment.</b> Since one of your residents forgot to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>, we no longer acquiesce to this partnership.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>According to Rabbi Akiva as well, let</b> the residents of the inner courtyard <b>say</b> to the residents of the outer courtyard: <b>We joined with you to</b> our <b>benefit and not to</b> our <b>detriment.</b> The Gemara answers that according to Rabbi Akiva, the case is <b>that</b> the residents of the outer courtyard <b>said</b> to the residents of the inner courtyard: <b>We renounce our rights in your favor,</b> in which case the inhabitants of the inner courtyard are permitted to carry in their own courtyard. Consequently, his ruling that the inner courtyard is also prohibited applies only before the residents of the outer courtyard renounce their rights. <b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that <b>there is no renunciation of rights from courtyard to courtyard.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who disagree about whether there is renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another, <b>disagree about the</b> same point that was the subject of a <b>disagreement between the Rabbis and Rabbi Akiva. As Shmuel said</b> that there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that such renunciation is valid, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b><br>The Gemara responds: <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: What I said is even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva stated</b> his opinion that there is renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another <b>only here, with regard to two courtyards, one within the other, which render each other prohibited. However, there,</b> where they disagree about two adjacent courtyards, <b>do</b> the courtyards <b>render each other prohibited?</b> Consequently, even Rabbi Akiva would agree that there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another.<br><b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said: What I said is even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis stated</b> their opinion that there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another <b>only</b> in the case <b>here, as</b> the residents of the inner courtyard <b>said to</b> the residents of the outer courtyard: <b>Until you renounce</b> your rights <b>in our favor, you render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for <b>us</b> to carry, and therefore, we will have no connection with you and forgo both the renunciation and the prohibition. <b>But there, does</b> one courtyard <b>prohibit</b> the other? Since it does not, even the Rabbis would agree that there is renunciation from one courtyard to another.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>And if</b> the courtyards belonged <b>to individuals,</b> i.e., if only one person lived in each courtyard, they are not required to establish an <i>eiruv</i>. <b>Rav Yosef said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>teaches</b> that if <b>there were three</b> people living in the two courtyards, whether two people lived in the outer courtyard and one person in the inner one, or two people lived in the inner courtyard and one person lived in the outer one, <b>they are prohibited</b> from carrying without an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rav Beivai said to</b> the Sages: <b>Do not listen to him,</b> as he is mistaken. <b>I told it to him, and I told it to him in the name of Rav Adda bar Ahava,</b> not Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, but due to his illness Rav Yosef forgot this detail. And the reason that the residents of both courtyards are prohibited from carrying if two people are living in the outer courtyard is that <b>since I call them many in the outer</b> courtyard, the Sages issued a decree prohibiting carrying, due to a case in which there are two people living in the inner courtyard. When he heard this, <b>Rav Yosef said</b> in astonishment: <b>Master of Abraham! I mistook</b> the word <b>Rabbi for</b> the word <b>many [<i>rabbim</i>].</b> He now realized that he had mistakenly understood this ruling as attributed to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rather than a <i>halakha</i> regarding many, an error that led to his inaccurate version of the teaching.<br><b>And Shmuel said: Actually, they are permitted, unless there are two</b> people living <b>in the inner</b> courtyard <b>and one in the outer one.</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar said: And a gentile is</b> considered <b>like many,</b> i.e., if a gentile lives in the inner courtyard, the gentile’s right of way in the outer courtyard renders it prohibited to carry there. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>an</b> individual <b>Jew</b> living in the inner courtyard, that <b>he does not prohibit</b> the resident of the outer courtyard? <b>Because one who knows</b> that only one person lives there <b>knows</b> this fact, <b>and one who does not know</b> this <b>thinks</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> has been established.</b> If so, in the case of <b>a gentile also, we</b> should <b>say that</b> one <b>who knows</b> that only one person lives there <b>knows,</b> and one <b>who does not know</b> this <b>thinks</b> that the Jew must have <b>rented</b> the domain from the gentile.<br>The Gemara answers: This is not so, as <b>a typical gentile, if he</b> had <b>rented</b> out his domain, <b>he would chatter</b> about it, and everyone would know. If he has not talked about it, everyone will assume that he did not rent out his domain.<br><b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If there are <b>ten houses, one within the other,</b> so that the person living in the innermost house must pass through all the rest in order to reach the courtyard, <b>the innermost one</b> alone <b>contributes to the <i>eiruv</i></b> for the courtyard, <b>and it is enough.</b> The residents of the other houses are considered as living in the gatehouse and corridor of the innermost one, and therefore they do not have to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> the <b>outer one</b> must contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara asks: The <b>outer</b> residence <b>is a gatehouse</b> in relation to the inner ones, so why should it have to contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring to the <b>outer</b> house <b>of</b> the <b>innermost one.</b> In other words, even the second-to-last house, the outer one only in relation to the innermost house, must contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>, as it is not viewed as a gatehouse.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? One Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that <b>the gatehouse of an individual is considered a gatehouse,</b> and therefore the ninth house, i.e., the second innermost is also a gatehouse, as it serves as a passageway for the individual living in the innermost house, <b>and one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that the gatehouse of an individual <b>is not considered a gatehouse,</b> and therefore the ninth house must also contribute to the <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>two courtyards</b> that have <b>three houses between them,</b> and a resident of <b>this</b> courtyard <b>comes through this</b> house that opens to his courtyard <b>and places his <i>eiruv</i> in that</b> middle house, <b>and</b> a resident of <b>this</b> other courtyard <b>comes through this</b> house that opens to his courtyard <b>and places his <i>eiruv</i> in that</b> middle house,<br><br></body></html>
