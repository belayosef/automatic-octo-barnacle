Daf 46a<br><br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: If the water was previously not in its current state, <b>all the more so should it be</b> considered as something that <b>came into being [<i>nolad</i>]</b> on the Festival, and consequently it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry it. Something that came into being or assumed its present form on Shabbat or Festivals is considered set-aside [<i>muktze</i>] and may not be handled on Shabbat or Festivals.<br><b>Rather,</b> we should say: <b>The water in clouds</b> is <b>in</b> constant <b>motion</b> and therefore does not acquire residence there. The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> answer, <b>the ocean should also not be difficult for you,</b> as the <b>water in the ocean is also in</b> constant <b>motion. And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Flowing rivers and streaming springs are like the feet of all people,</b> as their waters do not acquire residence in any particular place. The same law also applies to clouds and seas.<br><b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> that one who was asleep at the beginning of Shabbat may travel two thousand cubits in every direction. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi:</b> Did <b>you hear</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>explicitly</b> from Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <b>or did you understand it by inference</b> from some other ruling that he issued? Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi <b>said to him: I heard</b> it <b>explicitly</b> from him.<br>The Gemara asks: From <b>what</b> other teaching could this ruling <b>be inferred?</b> The Gemara explains: From that <b>which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need both?</b> Why was it necessary for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to state both the general ruling that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, and also the specific ruling that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri on this issue?<br><b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Both rulings <b>were necessary, as had he informed us</b> only that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, I would have said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with him <b>whether this is a leniency,</b> i.e., that a sleeping person acquires residence and may walk two thousand cubits in every direction, <b>or</b> whether <b>it is a stringency,</b> i.e., that ownerless utensils acquire residence and can be carried only two thousand cubits from that place. <b>Consequently, he teaches us</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> so that we rule in accordance with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri only when it entails a leniency.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Let him state</b> only that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>. Why do I need</b> the statement that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri?</b><br>The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>was necessary</b> as well, for had he informed us only that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it might have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this statement applies only</b> to disputes in which <b>a single</b> authority disagrees <b>with</b> another <b>single</b> authority, <b>or several</b> authorities disagree with <b>several</b> other authorities. <b>But</b> when <b>a single</b> authority maintains a lenient opinion against <b>several</b> authorities who maintain a more stringent position, you might have <b>said</b> that we do <b>not</b> rule in his favor. Hence, it was necessary to state that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri although he disputes the Rabbis.<br><b>Rava said to Abaye: Now, since</b> the laws of <b><i>eiruvin</i> are rabbinic</b> in origin, <b>what</b> reason is there for <b>me</b> to differentiate between a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority and a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with several</b> authorities?<br><b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Is there no difference with regard to rabbinic</b> laws <b>between</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority, <b>and</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority with <b>several</b> authorities?<br><b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Any woman who passed three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating. If afterward she sees blood, <b>it is enough</b> that she be regarded as ritually impure due to menstruation <b>from the time</b> that she examined herself and saw that she had a discharge, rather than retroactively for up to twenty-four hours. The Rabbis, however, maintain that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to an older woman or to a woman after childbirth, for whom it is natural to stop menstruating, but not to a normal young woman for whom three periods have passed without bleeding.<br><b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It once happened that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>ruled</b> that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. After he remembered</b> that Rabbi Elazar’s colleagues disagree with him on this matter and that he had apparently ruled incorrectly, <b>he</b> nonetheless <b>said: Rabbi Elazar is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>After he remembered? If you say</b> that it means <b>after he remembered</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar but</b> rather <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then <b>how could he rule in accordance with him</b> even <b>in exigent circumstances,</b> given that the <i>halakha</i> had been decided against him?<br><b>Rather,</b> it must be that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> had <b>not been stated</b> on this matter, <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And after he remembered that it was not a single</b> authority who <b>disagreed with</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>but</b> rather <b>several</b> authorities who <b>disagreed with him, he</b> nonetheless <b>said: Rabbi Elazar is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances.</b> This demonstrates that even with a dispute that involves a rabbinic decree, such as whether a woman is declared ritually impure retroactively, there is room to distinguish between a disagreement of a single authority and a single authority, and a disagreement of a single authority and several authorities.<br><b>Rav Mesharshiya said to Rava, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> who said <b>to Rava: Is there no difference with regard to rabbinic</b> laws <b>between</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority, <b>and</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with several</b> authorities?<br><b>Wasn’t it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a person receives <b>a proximate report</b> that one of his close relatives has died, <b>he practices</b> all the customs of the intense <b>seven</b> day mourning period as well as the customs of the <b>thirty</b> day mourning period. But if he receives <b>a distant</b> report, <b>he practices</b> only <b>one day</b> of mourning.<br><b>What is</b> considered a <b>proximate</b> report, <b>and what is</b> considered a <b>distant</b> report? If the report arrives <b>within thirty</b> days of the close relative’s passing, it is regarded as <b>proximate,</b> and if it arrives <b>after thirty</b> days it is considered <b>distant;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. But the Rabbis say: Both</b> in the case of <b>a proximate report and</b> in the case of <b>a distant report,</b> the grieving relative <b>practices</b> the <b>seven-</b>day mourning period <b>and</b> the <b>thirty-</b>day mourning period.<br><b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Wherever you find</b> that <b>a single</b> authority <b>is lenient</b> with regard to a certain <i>halakha</i> <b>and several</b> other authorities <b>are stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the words of the stringent</b> authorities, who constitute <b>the majority, except for here, where despite</b> the fact that the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva is lenient and the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis is</b> more <b>stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b><br><b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds like Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with</b> regard to <b>mourning</b> practices, i.e., wherever there is a dispute with regard to mourning customs, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion.<br>From here the Gemara infers: <b>It is</b> only <b>with regard to mourning</b> practices <b>that the Sages were lenient, but in general,</b> with regard to other areas of <i>halakha</i>, <b>even in the case of rabbinic</b> laws <b>there is a difference</b> between a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority and a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with several</b> authorities. This being the case, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi did well to rule explicitly that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, even though he is a single authority who ruled leniently in dispute with the Rabbis.<br><br>Daf 46b<br><br><b>Rav Pappa said</b> a different explanation for the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi made both statements: <b>It was necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to inform us that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, because had he said only that the <i>halakha</i> follows the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it could have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this statement applies only with regard to</b> the laws governing the <b><i>eiruv</i> of courtyards,</b> which are entirely rabbinic in origin. <b>But with regard to</b> the more stringent laws governing the <b><i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>limits,</b> you would have <b>said</b> that we should <b>not</b> rule leniently, and therefore <b>it was necessary</b> to make both statements.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we distinguish between an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards and an <i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>limits? As we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established for another person only with his knowledge? It was said <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>limits, but with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards, an <i>eiruv</i> may be established</b> for another person whether <b>with his knowledge or without his knowledge, as one may act in a person’s interest in his absence; however, one may not act to a person’s disadvantage in his absence.</b> One may act unilaterally on someone else’s behalf when the action is to that other person’s benefit; however, when it is to the other person’s detriment, or when there are both advantages and disadvantages to him, one may act on the other person’s behalf only if one has been explicitly appointed as an agent. Since an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards is always to a person’s benefit, it can be established even without his knowledge. However, with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> of Shabbat limits, while it enables one to walk in one direction, it disallows him from walking in the opposite direction. Therefore, it can be established only with his knowledge.<br><b>Rav Ashi said</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s need to issue two rulings can be explained in another manner: <b>It is necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to inform us that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as if he had said only that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it could have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this statement applies only with regard to the remnants of an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., an <i>eiruv</i> that had been properly established, where the concern is that it might subsequently have become invalid. <b>But with regard to an initial <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., an <i>eiruv</i> that is just being established and has not yet taken effect, you might have <b>said</b> that we should <b>not</b> rule leniently, and therefore it was necessary to issue both rulings.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we distinguish between the remnants of an <i>eiruv</i> and an initial <i>eiruv</i>? As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that the Sages stipulated that a fixed quantity of food is necessary for establishing an <i>eiruv</i>? It is said <b>with regard to an initial <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., when setting up an <i>eiruv</i> for the first time; <b>however, with regard to the remnants of an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., on a subsequent Shabbat when the measure may have become diminished, <b>even a minimal amount</b> suffices.<br><b>And they said to establish an <i>eiruv</i> for courtyards only</b> after all the inhabitants of the city merge their alleyways and become like the inhabitants of a single courtyard, <b>so that the law of <i>eiruv</i> should not be forgotten by the children,</b> who may not be aware of the arrangement that has been made with regard to the alleyways.<br>Since the Gemara discussed the principles cited with regard to halakhic decision-making, it cites additional principles. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Zerika said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> in disputes <b>with</b> any individual <b>Sage, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> even in disputes <b>with</b> other <b>Sages, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in disputes <b>with</b> any individual <b>Sage.</b><br>The Gemara asks: With regard <b>to what <i>halakha</i></b> do these principles apply, meaning, to what degree are they binding? <b>Rabbi Asi said:</b> This is considered binding <b><i>halakha</i>. And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One is inclined</b> toward such a ruling in cases where an individual asks, but does not issue it as a public ruling in all cases. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: It appears</b> that one should rule this way, but it is not an established <i>halakha</i> that is considered binding with regard to issuing rulings.<br><b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the case of a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda;</b> in the case of a dispute between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei; and, needless to say,</b> in the case of a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> As <b>now,</b> if <b>in disputes with Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the opinion of Rabbi Meir <b>is not</b> accepted as law, <b>need it</b> be stated that <b>in disputes with Rabbi Yosei,</b> Rabbi Meir’s opinion is rejected? Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is not accepted in disputes with Rabbi Yosei.<br><b>Rav Asi said: I also learn</b> based on the same principle that in a dispute between <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. As Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In cases of dispute between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Now,</b> if <b>where</b> it is opposed by <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon <b>is not</b> accepted as law, <b>where</b> it is opposed by the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> with whom the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance against Rabbi Yehuda, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei?<br>The Gemara <b>raises a dilemma:</b> In a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? No sources were found to resolve this dilemma, and it <b>stands</b> unresolved.<br><b>Rav Mesharshiya said: These principles</b> of halakhic decision-making <b>are not</b> to be relied upon. The Gemara asks: <b>From where does Rav Mesharshiya</b> derive <b>this</b> statement?<br><b>If you say</b> that he derived it <b>from that which we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this comparable?</b> It is like <b>three courtyards that open into one another, and</b> also <b>open into a public domain.</b> If <b>the two outer</b> courtyards <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with the middle one,</b> the residents of the middle one <b>are permitted to</b> carry to the two outer ones, <b>and they are permitted to</b> carry to <b>it, but the</b> residents of the <b>two outer</b> courtyards <b>are prohibited to</b> carry from <b>one</b> to the <b>other,</b> as they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with one another.<br><b>And Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon; and who disagrees with</b> Rabbi Shimon on this matter? It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Didn’t you say:</b> In disputes between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Rather, can we not conclude from</b> this mishna that these principles should <b>not</b> be relied upon?<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What is the difficulty</b> posed by this ruling? <b>Perhaps where it is stated</b> explicitly to the contrary, <b>it is stated,</b> but <b>where it is not stated</b> explicitly to the contrary, <b>it is not stated,</b> and these principles apply.<br><b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from that which we learned</b> elsewhere in a mishna: <b>If a city that belongs to a</b> single <b>individual</b> subsequently <b>becomes</b> one that <b>belongs to many</b> people, <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> of courtyards <b>for all of it.</b> But if the city <b>belongs to many</b> people, <b>and it</b> falls into the possession <b>of a</b> single <b>individual, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for all of it, unless he excludes</b> from the <i>eiruv</i> an area the size <b>of the town of Ḥadasha in Judea, which contains fifty residents;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b><br><br></body></html>
