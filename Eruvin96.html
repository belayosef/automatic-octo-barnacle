Daf 96a<br><br><b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>to fulfill</b> a mitzva <b>one does not need intent, and here they disagree with regard to</b> the condition needed <b>to violate</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not add</b> to mitzvot of the Torah. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>one does not need intent to violate</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not add</b> to mitzvot. One who dons another pair of phylacteries transgresses the prohibition against adding to mitzvot even if he does not don them with the intention of fulfilling the mitzva. <b>And Rabban Gamliel holds</b> that in order <b>to violate</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not add</b> to mitzvot, <b>one needs intent</b> to perform a mitzva. Since in this case one’s intention is merely to move the phylacteries to a safer place, he may don a second pair.<br><b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the dispute may be explained as follows. <b>If we were to maintain</b> that <b>Shabbat is</b> a fit <b>time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries, everyone</b> would <b>agree</b> that <b>one does not need intent to violate</b> the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, <b>nor does one need intent to fulfill</b> a mitzva. In this case, one’s intention has no bearing on his action.<br><b>However, here, they disagree with regard to</b> the condition for <b>violating</b> the prohibition against adding to a mitzva <b>not in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> i.e., when a mitzva is performed not at its prescribed time. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that if the act of a mitzva is performed not in its proper time, <b>one does not need intent;</b> that is, even if one does not intend to perform the mitzva he nonetheless violates the prohibition against adding to mitzvot by his action alone. Consequently, in this case, a person may not don more than one pair of phylacteries. <b>And Rabban Gamliel holds that to violate</b> the prohibition against adding to a mitzva <b>not in its</b> proper <b>time, one needs intent</b> to fulfill the mitzva. Without such intent one does not violate the prohibition, and therefore in this case he may don a second pair of phylacteries.<br>With regard to this last explanation the Gemara asks: <b>If so, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> one should <b>not even</b> don <b>one pair</b> of phylacteries. According to Rabbi Meir’s opinion, one who does so violates the prohibition against adding to mitzvot merely by donning one pair, since he is fulfilling the mitzva of phylacteries at a time when he is not commanded to do so.<br><b>And furthermore,</b> according to this opinion, <b>one who sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> on the Eighth Day</b> of Assembly <b>should be flogged</b> for violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, as he adds to the mitzva of: “You shall dwell in booths for seven days” (Leviticus 23:42). Yet the Sages instituted that outside of Eretz Yisrael, Jews must observe <i>Sukkot</i> for eight days, even though one who sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> on the eighth night outside of Eretz Yisrael transgresses a Torah law. <b>Rather, it is clear as we originally answered,</b> i.e., you must accept one of the other explanations.<br>Since the topic of phylacteries was discussed, the Gemara continues to explore this issue. <b>Whom did you hear</b> who said that <b>Shabbat is</b> a fit <b>time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the end of the section in the Torah beginning with: “Sanctify all firstborns to me” (Exodus 13:2), which deals with the mitzvot of the Paschal lamb and phylacteries: <b>“And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [<i>miyamim</i>] to year”</b> (Exodus 13:10), which indicates that these mitzvot apply during the <b>days</b> [<b><i>yamim</i></b>] <b>and not</b> during the <b>nights.</b> Furthermore, the letter <i>mem</i> in <b>“from year” [<i>miyamim</i>]</b> teaches: <b>But not</b> on <b>all days;</b> this <b>excludes Shabbat and Festivals,</b> on which phylacteries are not worn. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b><br><b>Rabbi Akiva says: This ordinance is stated only with regard to the Paschal</b> lamb, and it does not refer to phylacteries at all. According to Rabbi Akiva, there is no reason to refrain from donning phylacteries on Shabbat and Festivals.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>the Paschal</b> lamb <b>and circumcision are positive mitzvot, let us say that</b> this statement is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The reason for this claim is <b>that if</b> you say this teaching is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, since he establishes</b> this verse as referring <b>to the Paschal</b> lamb, this would mean that in failure to bring this offering there <b>is also</b> the violation of <b>a negative</b> mitzva, <b>in accordance with</b> the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Elai said. As Rabbi Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elai said: Any place</b> where <b>it is stated: Observe, lest, or do not,</b> this means <b>nothing other than a negative</b> mitzva, as these are negative terms. Consequently, the verse “You shall observe this ordinance,” which refers to the Paschal lamb, constitutes a negative mitzva.<br>The Gemara rejects this: <b>Even if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> holds that no negative mitzva applies to the Paschal lamb, it is not difficult, as an additional principle must be taken into account. Although it is true that the term <b>observe with regard to a negative</b> mitzva indicates the presence of another <b>negative</b> mitzva; that same term <b>observe</b> with regard to <b>a positive</b> mitzva has the force of <b>a positive</b> mitzva, as the Torah is warning adherents to take special care in the observance of a mitzva. The word observe in connection with the Paschal lamb is an example of this type of positive mitzva.<br>The Gemara returns to the issue at hand: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> really <b>hold that Shabbat is a time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person should don phylacteries on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm,</b> and for a remembrance between your eyes, so that God’s law shall be in your mouth; for with a strong arm God brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:9). The obligation to don phylacteries applies when Jews <b>require a sign</b> to assert their Judaism and their status as the Chosen People, i.e., during the week, <b>excluding</b> Shabbat and Festivals, <b>as they are themselves signs</b> of Israel’s status as the Chosen People and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days. This teaching proves that Rabbi Akiva maintains that Shabbat is not a fit time for donning phylacteries.<br><b>Rather, it is this <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Natan, who maintains that Shabbat is a fit time for donning phylacteries, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who is awake at night, if he wishes he</b> may <b>remove</b> his phylacteries, and <b>if he wishes he</b> may continue to <b>don</b> them, and he need not worry about violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Natan. Yonatan HaKitoni says: One</b> may <b>not don phylacteries at night. From</b> the fact <b>that according to the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Natan, <b>night is</b> a fit <b>time for phylacteries,</b> it may be inferred that <b>Shabbat, too, is a time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries,</b> as Rabbi Natan evidently does not accept Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s limitation based on the phrase: From year to year.<br>The Gemara rejects this contention: This is not a conclusive proof, as <b>perhaps he holds</b> that although <b>night is</b> a fit <b>time for phylacteries, Shabbat is not</b> a fit <b>time for phylacteries. As we</b> have <b>heard that Rabbi Akiva said</b> that <b>night is a time for phylacteries,</b> because he does not accept the limitation of “from days to days,” and yet he maintains that <b>Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries,</b> as no sign is required on Shabbat. It is therefore possible that Rabbi Natan holds the same opinion.<br><b>Rather,</b> we must say that <b>it is this <i>tanna</i></b> who maintains that Shabbat is a time for phylacteries, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Michal, daughter of Kushi,</b> King Saul, <b>would don phylacteries, and the Sages did not protest against her</b> behavior, as she was permitted to do so. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Jonah’s wife would undertake the Festival pilgrimage and the Sages did not protest against her</b> practice. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the Sages did not protest against</b> Michal’s donning phylacteries, <b>it is apparent that these</b> Sages <b>hold</b> that phylacteries <b>is a positive mitzva not bound by time,</b> i.e., it is a mitzva whose performance is mandated at all times, including nights and Shabbat. There is an accepted principle that women are obligated in all positive mitzvot not bound by time.<br>The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>But perhaps</b> that <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b><br><br>Daf 96b<br><br><b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said:</b> It is <b>optional</b> for <b>women</b> to <b>place</b> their hands on the head of a sacrificial animal before it is slaughtered. Although only men have this obligation, women may perform that rite if they wish. Similarly, women may perform other mitzvot that they have no obligation to fulfill.<br><b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that this <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, the <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Jonah’s wife would ascend</b> to Jerusalem for <b>the Festival pilgrimage and</b> the Sages <b>did not reprimand her. Is there anyone who says</b> that the mitzva of <b>Festival</b> pilgrimage <b>is not a time-bound positive mitzva</b> and that women are obligated to fulfill it? <b>Rather, he holds</b> that she did not embark on the pilgrimage as an obligation, but that it was <b>optional; here, too,</b> with regard to phylacteries, it is <b>optional.</b> Consequently, no proof can be cited from this <i>baraita</i> as to whether or not Shabbat is a fit time for phylacteries.<br><b>Rather,</b> who is the <i>tanna</i> who maintains that Shabbat is a time for phylacteries? <b>It is this <i>tanna</i></b> who taught the <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who finds phylacteries brings them in pair</b> by <b>pair, whether</b> the finder is <b>a man or whether</b> she is <b>a woman,</b> and <b>whether</b> the phylacteries are <b>new or whether</b> they are <b>old.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> bringing in <b>new</b> phylacteries since they might merely be amulets in the form of phylacteries, <b>but</b> he <b>permits</b> bringing in <b>old</b> ones, which are certainly valid phylacteries.<br>Analysis of this <i>Tosefta</i> indicates that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree only with regard to</b> the issue of <b>new</b> phylacteries <b>and old ones; however, with regard to a woman</b> bringing in the phylacteries, <b>they do not disagree</b> that it is permitted. <b>Learn from it</b> that this <i>tanna</i> maintains that donning phylacteries <b>is a positive mitzva not bound by time, and</b> since <b>women are obligated in every positive mitzva not bound by time,</b> a woman may don these phylacteries and walk into the town.<br>The Gemara attempts to refute this. <b>But perhaps</b> that <i>tanna</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said:</b> It is <b>optional</b> for <b>women</b> to <b>place</b> their hands on the head of a sacrificial animal before it is slaughtered. Here too, perhaps it is optional for women to don phylacteries. The Gemara answers: <b>This cannot enter your mind, as neither Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, nor does Rabbi Yehuda hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> as the Gemara proceeds to prove.<br><b>Neither Rabbi Meir holds in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One</b> need <b>not prevent children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana. Although there is an element of prohibition in sounding the <i>shofar</i> when there is no obligation to do so, since the children will one day be obligated to sound the <i>shofar</i>, one need not prevent them from doing so and learning. It may be inferred from here that <b>one must prevent women</b> from sounding the <i>shofar</i>. <b>And an unattributed mishna</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> indicating that according to Rabbi Meir, a woman does not even have the option of performing a time-bound positive mitzva.<br><b>Nor does Rabbi Yehuda hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as it was taught</b> in the <i>Sifra</i>, the halakhic <i>midrash</i> on Leviticus. The verse states: <b>“Speak to the sons of Israel…and he shall place</b> his hands on the head of the burnt-offering” (Leviticus 1:2–4). By inference, <b>the sons of Israel place</b> their hands, <b>but the daughters of Israel do not place</b> their hands. <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> It is <b>optional</b> for <b>women</b> to <b>place</b> their hands on the head of a sacrificial animal before it is slaughtered.<br><b>And who is</b> the author of <b>an unattributed <i>Sifra</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> This teaching proves that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that women do not have the option of placing their hands on a sacrifice. Neither Rabbi Meir nor Rabbi Yehuda accepts Rabbi Yosei’s opinion that it is optional for women to perform time-bound positive mitzvot; therefore, the <i>tanna</i> who cited their opinions that a woman may bring in phylacteries on Shabbat maintains that the mitzva of phylacteries is not time-bound and is in effect even on Shabbat, which is why even women are obligated.<br><b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> With regard to <b>one who one finds</b> fabric dyed <b>sky blue in the marketplace,</b> if he found <b>strips</b> of combed and dyed wool <b>they are unfit</b> for use as ritual fringes. The sky blue threads used in ritual fringes must be spun and dyed for the purpose of the mitzva, and these strips might have been dyed for a different purpose. However, if one found sky blue <b>threads, they are fit</b> for use in ritual fringes, as it can be assumed they were prepared for that purpose.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>strips</b> that renders them unfit? It is because Rabbi Elazar <b>said: One dyed</b> the strips <b>with the intent</b> to use them <b>for a cloak.</b> If so, with regard to <b>threads as well, let us say: One spun them with the intent</b> to use them <b>for a cloak.</b> In that case, they too would be deemed unfit. The Gemara answers: Here, it is referring to threads that are <b>twisted,</b> which are not typically used for weaving.<br>The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>twisted</b> threads <b>as well, let us say</b> that <b>one twisted them with the intent</b> of attaching them to <b>the hem of a cloak</b> as ornamentation. The Gemara answers: It is referring to twisted threads <b>that were cut</b> into short strings suitable for use as ritual fringes, <b>as people certainly do not exert</b> themselves and fashion fringes of a cloak to resemble ritual fringes.<br><b>Rava said:</b> The assertion that people do not exert themselves is problematic, <b>as</b> by the same token, <b>does a person exert</b> himself <b>to fashion an amulet in the form of phylacteries?</b> Nevertheless, the Sages were concerned that an object that appears to be phylacteries might actually be a different object. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside on Shabbat <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to old</b> phylacteries. <b>However, with regard to new</b> ones, <b>he is exempt</b> from the obligation to bring them in, as it is possible that they are not phylacteries but amulets in the form of phylacteries. Similarly, there should be concern lest people fashion items similar to objects used for a mitzva, even if exertion is involved.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira said to his son Ahava: Go out and teach</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to</b> the Sages. With regard to <b>one who finds</b> fabric dyed <b>sky blue in the marketplace,</b> if he finds <b>strips, they are unfit</b> for use in ritual fringes; however, if he finds <b>threads cut</b> into short strings, <b>they are fit</b> for use in ritual fringes <b>because a person does not exert</b> himself. Apparently, that is the reason for the <i>halakha</i>.<br><b>Rava said: And because Ahava, son of Rabbi Zeira, taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>has he hung</b> ornamental <b>rings on</b> that line of reasoning, i.e., does that constitute an absolute proof? The difficulty posed by Rava from the mishna is not resolved by the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as we learned: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to old</b> phylacteries. <b>However, with regard to new</b> ones, <b>he is exempt.</b> Apparently, there is concern lest one exert himself to fashion an object similar to one used in a mitzva.<br><b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The sources are not contradictory, as the question of whether one <b>exerts</b> himself <b>or does not exert</b> himself <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> Some hold that one exerts himself as indicated by the mishna with regard to phylacteries, whereas others hold that one does not exert himself as stated with regard to sky blue dye.<br><b>As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who finds phylacteries</b> in a field <b>brings them in</b> to the town <b>pair</b> by <b>pair, whether</b> the finder is <b>a man or a woman,</b><br><br></body></html>
