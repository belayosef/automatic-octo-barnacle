Daf 59a<br><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Does this mean that in <b>a place where he extended</b> the limit, <b>yes,</b> the surveyor’s measurements are accepted, but in <b>a place where he reduced</b> the limit, <b>no,</b> his measurements are not accepted? If his extended measurement is accepted, his shortened measurement should certainly be accepted as well. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the mishna means that the surveyor’s measurements are accepted <b>even</b> in <b>a place where he extended</b> the limit, without concern that he might have erred (<i>Tosafot</i>), and that the surveyor’s measurements are certainly accepted in places where he reduced the Shabbat limit.<br>We learned in the mishna: If the surveyor <b>extended</b> the limit <b>for one and reduced</b> it <b>for another,</b> one accepts the extended measurement. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need this as well? This</b> clause <b>is the same as that</b> previous clause in the mishna. The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>said:</b> If two surveyors measured the Shabbat limit and <b>one extended</b> the Shabbat limit <b>and one reduced</b> it, <b>one accepts</b> the measurements of <b>the</b> surveyor <b>who extended</b> it.<br><b>Abaye said:</b> The measurements of the surveyor who extended the limit are accepted only <b>as long as he does not extend</b> the limit <b>more than</b> the difference between <b>the measure</b> of the Shabbat limit <b>of the city</b> calculated <b>as a diagonal</b> line from the corner of the city and as calculated as a straight line from the side of the city. If, however, the difference in measurements exceeds that amount, the Shabbat limit must be measured again.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>As the Sages did not state the matter,</b> the laws of Shabbat limits, <b>to be stringent, but</b> rather <b>to be lenient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t</b> the opposite <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sages did not state the matter,</b> the laws of Shabbat limits, <b>to be lenient but</b> rather <b>to be stringent?</b><br><b>Ravina said</b> that there is no contradiction between these two statements: The very institution of Shabbat limits was enacted <b>not to be</b> more <b>lenient</b> than <b>Torah law,</b> but <b>rather to be stringent</b> beyond <b>Torah law.</b> Nonetheless, since <b>Shabbat limits are rabbinic law,</b> the Sages permitted certain leniencies with regard to how the Shabbat limits are measured.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although this chapter as a whole deals with <i>halakhot</i> governing the joining of Shabbat boundaries, this mishna returns to the <i>halakhot</i> governing a joining of courtyards. If <b>a private city,</b> which does not have many residents, grows and <b>becomes</b> a heavily populated <b>public</b> city, <b>one may establish a joining of the courtyards for all of it,</b> as long as it does not include a public domain as defined by Torah law.<br><b>And</b> if <b>a public</b> city loses residents over time and <b>becomes a private</b> city, <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for all of it unless one maintains</b> an area <b>outside</b> the <i>eiruv</i> that is <b>like</b> the size of <b>the city of Ḥadasha in Judea, which has fifty residents.</b> Carrying within the <i>eiruv</i> is permitted, but it remains prohibited to carry in the area excluded from the <i>eiruv</i>. The reason for this requirement is to ensure that the laws of <i>eiruv</i> will not be forgotten. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The excluded area need not be so large; rather, it is sufficient to exclude <b>three courtyards</b> with <b>two houses</b> each.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a private city</b> that <b>becomes a public</b> city? <b>Rav Yehuda said: For example, the Exilarch’s village [<i>de’iskarta</i>]</b> was a small village set aside for the Exilarch’s family and attendants; since it was frequented by many people, it turned into a public city.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said to him: What is the reason</b> for bringing this example? <b>If you say</b> that <b>because</b> large numbers of people <b>are to be found at</b> the residence of <b>the governor [<i>harmana</i>]</b> in order to request licenses and authorizations, and <b>they remind each other</b> of the reason it is permissible to establish an <i>eiruv</i> there, and consequently they will not arrive at mistaken conclusions with regard to other places, then every city should have the same status, as <b>the entire Jewish people are also found together on Shabbat morning</b> when they come to pray. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said: For example, the village of Natzu’i</b> was a private city belonging to a single individual before a large influx of residents turned it into a public city.<br><b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a private city becomes public, and</b> a bona fide <b>public domain passes through it, how does one establish an <i>eiruv</i> for it? He places a side post from here,</b> one side of the public domain, <b>and side post from there,</b> the other side; <b>or,</b> he places a cross <b>beam from here,</b> one side of the public domain, <b>and</b> another cross <b>beam from there,</b> the other side. <b>He may</b> then <b>carry</b> items <b>and place</b> them <b>between</b> these symbolic partitions, as the public domain is now considered like one of the courtyards of the city. <b>And one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for half</b> the city; <b>rather,</b> one may establish <b>either</b> one <i>eiruv</i> for <b>all of it or</b> separate ones for <b>each alleyway separately</b> without including the other sections of the city.<br>The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>it was</b> originally <b>a public</b> city, <b>and it</b> remains <b>a public</b> city,<br><br>Daf 59b<br><br><b>and it has only one entrance,</b> as it is surrounded by a wall or enclosed by houses on all sides, <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for all of it.</b><br>The Gemara raises a question concerning this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established for a public domain</b> in this manner? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: It is Rabbi Yehuda, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: One who has two houses</b> opposite each other <b>on two sides of the public domain,</b> if he chooses, <b>he may</b> create a private domain for himself in the public domain. He may <b>place</b> a ten-handbreadth high <b>post from here,</b> on one side, <b>and</b> an additional <b>post from there,</b> the other side. This creates symbolic walls that provide the public domain with the legal status of a private domain. <b>Or,</b> one may place <b>a beam</b> extending <b>from here,</b> one end of the house, <b>and a beam from there,</b> the other end of the house, thereby creating symbolic partitions across the width of the street. In that way, one is permitted to <b>carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in</b> the area <b>between</b> the symbolic partitions, as he would in a private domain. The Rabbis <b>said to him: One may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> in the public domain in that</b> way.<br><b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> quoted above: <b>And one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for half</b> the city. <b>Rav Pappa said: They said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case where one wishes to divide the city <b>according to its length.</b> Generally, a city had a public domain that ran straight across it, from the entrance on one side of the city to the entrance on its other side. The <i>baraita</i> rules that it is prohibited to establish an <i>eiruv</i> separately for the residents of each side of the public domain. <b>But</b> if one wants to divide the city <b>according to its width, he may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for half the city. This distinction is made because in the first case the public domain that runs between the two halves is used by the residents of both halves, and therefore it joins the two into a single unit; in the second case, the residents of each half use only the half of the public domain located on their side and not the half of the public domain located on the other side.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As, if</b> it were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, didn’t he say that a foot that is permitted in its</b> own <b>place prohibits</b> carrying <b>even in a place that is not its own?</b> Rabbi Akiva holds the following in the case of outer and inner courtyards, in which the residents of each courtyard established their own, independent <i>eiruv</i>: Since the residents of the inner courtyard, who are permitted to carry in their own courtyard, may not carry in the outer courtyard despite the fact that they have rights of passage there, it is prohibited even for the residents of the outer courtyard to carry there. By the same logic, since the residents of each half of the city are prohibited to carry in the public domain of the city’s other half, despite the fact that they may travel there, it should be prohibited for everyone to carry there, and the <i>eiruv</i> should not be functional.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even if you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Akiva stated</b> his opinion <b>there only in</b> a case of <b>two courtyards, one</b> farther <b>inside</b> than <b>the other, as the inner</b> courtyard <b>has no other entrance.</b> Since the residents of the inner courtyard have no choice but to pass through the outer courtyard, the residents of the outer courtyard deny the residents of the inner courtyard exclusive use of their own courtyard; therefore, they can impose restrictions upon them. <b>But here,</b> in the case of two halves of the city, <b>these may go out through this</b> part of the public domain on their side of the city, leading to one <b>entrance</b> to the city, <b>and these may go out through this</b> other part of the public domain, leading to the other <b>entrance</b> to the city. Since the residents of each half do not have to use the portion of the public domain located in the other half, they do not impose any restrictions on the residents of the other half, even if they do in fact use it.<br><b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion. <b>Rav Pappa said: Do not say that it is</b> only if the city is divided <b>according to its length that one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for half the city, <b>but</b> if the city is divided <b>according to its width, one may establish</b> a separate <b><i>eiruv</i></b> for each half. <b>Rather, even</b> if the city is divided <b>according to its width, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for half the city.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even if you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it is possible that <b>the Rabbis stated</b> their opinion <b>there only in</b> the case of <b>two courtyards, one inside the other, as</b> the residents of <b>the inner</b> courtyard <b>can close the door</b> to the outer courtyard <b>and use</b> only their own courtyard. In doing so, they impose no restrictions on the residents of the outer courtyard. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the division of a city, <b>are they able to move the public domain from here?</b> Since the residents of each half cannot be prevented from using the public domain located in the other half, even the Rabbis would agree that the <i>eiruv</i> is ineffective.<br><b>The Master said</b> in the previously cited <i>baraita</i> that an <i>eiruv</i> must <b>either</b> be established <b>for all of it or</b> for <b>each alleyway separately.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about an <i>eiruv</i> <b>for half</b> the city, <b>which is not</b> permissible? The residents of each half <b>prohibit</b> residents of the <b>other</b> from carrying, due to the fact that all the residents may use both halves. Similarly, even if they establish a separate <i>eiruv</i> for <b>each alleyway,</b> the residents should still <b>prohibit</b> residents of the <b>other</b> from carrying, as residents of one alleyway commonly enter other alleyways as well.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the residents <b>erected a partition</b> at the entrance to the alleyway as an indication that they do not want to be connected to the other alleyways. <b>And</b> it is <b>like that</b> which <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: One of the residents of an alleyway, who made a partition for his entrance</b> to the alleyway as a sign that he does not intend to carry from his house to the alleyway, <b>does not prohibit the</b> other <b>residents of the alleyway</b> from carrying there if he does not join in their <i>eiruv</i>. The reason for this is that this resident has demonstrated his desire to renounce his share of the alleyway.<br>It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>it was</b> originally <b>a public</b> city <b>and it is</b> still <b>a public</b> city, and it has only one entrance to the public domain, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for the entire city. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Zeira established an <i>eiruv</i> for Rabbi Ḥiyya’s city and did not leave any section</b> of the city <b>out</b> of the <i>eiruv</i>. <b>Abaye said to him: What is the reason that the Master acted in this</b> manner? Why didn’t you exclude a section of the city from the <i>eiruv</i>, as required in a public city?<br>Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>The</b> city <b>Elders told me</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Asi</b> used to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the <b>entire</b> city without excluding any section of it, <b>and I said</b> to myself: If he would establish an <i>eiruv</i> for the whole city, I can <b>learn from this</b> that it was originally <b>a private city and</b> later <b>becomes a public one.</b> Therefore, it is permitted to establish an <i>eiruv</i> for the entire city.<br>Abaye <b>said to him: Those</b> same <b>Elders told me</b> that the reason was different: <b>There was a particular garbage</b> dump <b>on one side</b> of the public domain, which blocked one of the entrances, leaving only one entrance to the public domain. However, <b>now that the garbage</b> dump <b>has been cleared away, it has two entrances, and</b> it <b>is</b> therefore <b>prohibited</b> to establish an <i>eiruv</i> for the whole city without excluding a section from the <i>eiruv</i>. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: It was not on my mind,</b> i.e., I was unaware that this was the situation.<br><b>Rav Ami bar Adda from Harpanya raised a dilemma before Rabba:</b> If a public domain has <b>a ladder on one side,</b> to allow people to scale the wall that blocks it, <b>and an entrance on the other side, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered a public domain that is open on both sides? Rabba <b>said to him</b> that <b>Rav said as follows: A ladder has the status of an entrance,</b> and therefore the public domain is considered open on both sides.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said to them: Do not listen to him. Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rav said as follows: A ladder has the status of an entrance</b> in certain cases, <b>and it has the status of a partition</b> in other cases. <b>It has the status of a partition</b> in the case that <b>we mentioned,</b> where there is a ladder at the end of a public domain. In this case, the ladder is not considered an entrance and therefore the public domain is considered closed at that end. <b>It has the status of an entrance in</b> the case of <b>a ladder between two courtyards.</b> If the residents of the courtyards <b>wish,</b> they may join the two courtyards by means of the ladder and <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>;</b> if <b>they wish,</b> the <b>two</b> courtyards may each <b>establish</b> a separate <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rav Naḥman</b> actually <b>say this? Didn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>residents of</b> the ground floor of <b>a courtyard and residents of a balcony,</b> i.e., the floor above the ground floor, <b>who forgot</b><br><br></body></html>
