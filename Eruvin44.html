Daf 44a<br><br><b>or is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel? Or perhaps we are dealing with</b> a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could <b>not be filled with people</b> who had established an <i>eiruv</i> and were permitted to establish a human partition for Neḥemya. In that case, there were enough people to establish partitions from where Neḥemya was standing to within two cubits from the limit, <b>and</b> the dilemma that Rav Ḥisda <b>raised</b> was: <b>Is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that someone who went two cubits outside of his Shabbat limit may reenter it, <b>or is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b><br>The Gemara answers: This is <b>obvious that we are dealing with</b> a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could <b>not be filled with people, as if it should enter your mind that we are dealing with</b> a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could be fully <b>filled with people, what is</b> Rav Ḥisda’s <b>dilemma? Didn’t Rav say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a pen, a stable, and a boat? Rather, we</b> must be <b>dealing with</b> a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could <b>not be filled with people, and</b> the dilemma that <b>he raised was</b> about the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> interpretation is <b>also precise</b> and implicit in Rav Naḥman’s answer, <b>for</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: Establish a human partition for him, and <b>let him reenter</b> his Shabbat limit. <b>Doesn’t</b> the statement: <b>Let him reenter,</b> mean that he may reenter even <b>without a partition</b> along those two additional two cubits, i.e., that after he passes through the human partitions, he would still need to cross the remaining two cubits on his own without the benefit of a partition?<br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> with regard to the principle of making a human partition on Shabbat, from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the wall</b> of a <i>sukka</i> <b>fell</b> on a Festival or on Shabbat, thus rendering the <i>sukka</i> unfit for the mitzva, <b>one may not position people, animals or utensils there</b> in its place in order to form a wall, <b>nor may one turn a bed upright in order to spread a sheet over it,</b> which will thereby serve as a partition, <b>because one may not make a temporary tent for the first</b> time <b>on a Festival, and, needless to say,</b> this is prohibited <b>on Shabbat.</b> This indicates that a human partition may not be erected on Shabbat.<br>Rava <b>said to him: You state to me</b> that this is prohibited <b>from this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>but I</b> can <b>state to you</b> that it is permitted <b>from this</b> other <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may position his fellow as a wall, so that he may eat, drink, and sleep</b> in a <i>sukka</i>, <b>and</b> he is likewise permitted to <b>turn a bed upright</b> in order to <b>spread a sheet over it, so that the sun should not beat down on a corpse, or on food.</b><br>The Gemara comments: If so, these two <i>baraitot</i> <b>contradict one another.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> <i>baraita</i> that teaches that it is prohibited reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>this</b> other <i>baraita</i> that teaches that it is permitted reflects the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a window shutter</b> that is not fixed to the wall with hinges, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If it is tied</b> to the wall <b>and hangs</b> from the window, <b>one may shut</b> the window <b>with it; but if not, one may not shut</b> the window <b>with it,</b> since one may not erect a tent, even a temporary one, on Shabbat. <b>But the Rabbis say: In either case, one may shut</b> the window <b>with it.</b> This indicates that the Rabbis permit constructing a temporary wall of this sort on Shabbat, and they also permit the construction of a temporary wall in the case of a <i>sukka</i>.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> dispute: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All agree that one may not make a temporary tent for the first</b> time <b>on a Festival, and, needless to say,</b> this is prohibited <b>on Shabbat.</b> The Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer <b>disagree only with regard to adding</b> a temporary tent to a permanent structure, as in the case of a window shutter. <b>As Rabbi Eliezer says: One may not add</b> a temporary tent to a permanent structure even <b>on a Festival; and, needless to say,</b> this is prohibited <b>on Shabbat. And the Rabbis say: One may add</b> a temporary tent to a permanent structure <b>on Shabbat, and needless to say,</b> this is permitted <b>on a Festival.</b> This indicates that there is no opinion that grants license to construct a temporary wall for the first time.<br><b>Rather,</b> the Gemara resolves the contradiction differently: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> that permits the positioning of an animal or a person as a wall was taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> that prohibits it was taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who positions an animal</b> to serve <b>as the wall of a <i>sukka</i>, Rabbi Meir deems it unfit,</b> out of concern that the animal might leave, whereas <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit.</b><br><b>Rabbi Meir, who deems</b> the wall <b>unfit there,</b> with regard to a <i>sukka</i>, <b>apparently</b> holds that a partition established from a living creature <b>is not a partition</b> and he would <b>here,</b> in the case of Shabbat, rule that it is <b>permitted</b> to construct such a wall, as <b>he is not doing anything,</b> since it is not considered actual construction.<br>However, <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who deems</b> the wall <b>to be fit there,</b> with regard to a <i>sukka</i>, <b>apparently</b> holds that it <b>is a</b> proper <b>partition;</b> and he would <b>here,</b> in the case of Shabbat, <b>prohibit</b> the construction of such a partition.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it in that manner? <b>Say</b> that <b>you heard that Rabbi Meir</b> deemed the <i>sukka</i> to be unfit in the case where <b>an animal</b> was used to serve as a partition, but <b>did you hear</b> that he deemed the <i>sukka</i> to be similarly unfit if <b>a person or utensils</b> were used as walls? The reason that an animal may not be used as a partition, according to his opinion, is because it might leave. This concern does not apply to people or utensils, since a person is under his own control and can remain standing, and utensils do not move themselves. Since the <i>baraita</i> validates partitions established with people and utensils as well as animals, it cannot be based on the opinion of Rabbi Meir.<br><b>And furthermore,</b> even if you do not differentiate as above, and instead assume that the consideration that the animal might leave is pertinent, <b>according to whose</b> opinion does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> state his opinion with regard to constructing a temporary tent on Shabbat? <b>If</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of his teacher <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> this is difficult, as <b>he even prohibited adding</b> a window shutter, i.e., a temporary tent, to a permanent structure.<br><b>Rather,</b> you must say that he stated his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> However, even according to their opinion, <b>say that the Rabbis</b> only <b>said</b> that one is permitted <b>to add</b> a temporary tent to a permanent structure; but <b>did they say that</b> it is permitted to construct a partition or a tent <b>for the first time?</b><br><b>Rather,</b> say that both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> follow the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and this is the resolution of the various contradictions: With regard to the contradiction between the one ruling concerning <b>utensils</b> and the other ruling concerning <b>utensils,</b> this is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling that prohibits the construction of an additional wall refers <b>to</b> the <b>third wall</b> of a <i>sukka</i>, which renders it fit for the mitzva; whereas <b>this</b> other ruling that permits the construction of an additional wall refers <b>to</b> the <b>fourth wall</b> of a <i>sukka</i>, which is insignificant, as a <i>sukka</i> need not have four walls.<br><b>This</b> interpretation <b>is also precise</b> in the wording of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as</b> the <i>baraita</i> that prohibits the construction of an additional wall uses the following phrase: <b>If its wall fell.</b> This indicates a wall that is significant, i.e., a wall that renders it fit for use, rather than any wall, as stated in the <i>baraita</i> that permits it. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that the correct resolution is to differentiate between the third and fourth wall of a <i>sukka</i>.<br><br>Daf 44b<br><br><b>However,</b> with regard to the contradiction between the one ruling concerning <b>a person</b> and the other ruling concerning <b>a person,</b> it is <b>difficult,</b> for one <i>baraita</i> states that one may not use a person as the wall of a <i>sukka</i>, while the other says that one may use a person as a wall and even states explicitly that he may do this: So that he may eat, drink and sleep in the <i>sukka</i>. That implies that this is permitted even if it is the third wall that is missing.<br>The Gemara answers: With regard to the contradiction between the one ruling concerning <b>a person</b> and the other ruling concerning <b>a person,</b> it is <b>also not difficult. Here,</b> where it is prohibited, the <i>baraita</i> refers to a case where that person <b>knowingly</b> served as a partition; whereas <b>here,</b> where it is permitted, it refers to a case where that person <b>unknowingly</b> served as a partition, which is not the usual manner of building. This is not the case with regard to utilizing a utensil as a partition. Since the utensil lacks knowledge, it is considered a partition regardless of how it is placed, and it is prohibited in all cases.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>However,</b> the case involving <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, son of Rabbi Ḥanilai, was</b> a case where people <b>knowingly</b> served as a partition, as the people were instructed to go out and serve as a human partition. The Gemara answers: In fact, that <b>was</b> a case where people <b>unknowingly</b> served as a partition, i.e., they were unaware why they were called, and were made into a partition without their knowledge.<br>The Gemara asks: However, <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who gathered the people to that spot, <b>was in any case</b> present <b>knowingly.</b> The Gemara answers: While <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> was there knowingly, he <b>was not among the designated</b> people who served as a partition.<br>The Gemara relates that there were <b>these members of a wedding</b> party who engaged the many people present <b>to bring water in</b> on Shabbat from a public domain to a private domain <b>through walls comprised of people</b> who knew that they were being used as partitions for that purpose. <b>Shmuel</b> instructed that <b>they</b> should <b>be flogged. He said</b> with regard to this matter: <b>If</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that a partition is effective when the people act <b>unknowingly,</b> does this mean that <b>they would</b> also <b>say</b> that this is permitted <i>ab initio</i> when they <b>knowingly</b> serve as a partition?<br>The Gemara relates that there <b>were</b> once <b>these flasks lying in the market [<i>ristaka</i>] of Meḥoza</b> on Shabbat and could not be moved. <b>When Rava was coming from his discourse</b> accompanied by a throng of people, his attendants <b>brought</b> the flasks <b>into his</b> house, as the crowd of people created human partitions, upon which the attendants capitalized for this purpose. <b>On another Shabbat they wanted to bring them in</b> again, <b>but</b> Rava <b>prohibited them</b> from doing so, reasoning: <b>This is like</b> the case where the people <b>knowingly</b> served as partitions, for presumably the people now knew that they were being used for this purpose, <b>and it is</b> therefore <b>prohibited.</b><br>The Gemara further relates that <b>Levi was brought straw</b> through human partitions comprised of people who were unknowingly used for this purpose, and in the same manner <b>Ze’eiri</b> was brought <b>fodder [<i>aspasta</i>],</b> and <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya</b> was brought <b>water.</b><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who was permitted to leave</b> his Shabbat limit, i.e., he went out to testify that he had seen the new moon or for some life-saving purpose, <b>and they said to him</b> along the way: <b>The action has already been performed,</b> and there is no need for you to travel for that purpose, <b>he has two thousand cubits in each direction</b> from the location where he was standing when this was told to him.<br><b>If he was within</b> his original <b>limit,</b> it is considered <b>as if he had not left</b> his limit, and he may return to his original location. The Sages formulated a principle: <b>All who go out to</b> battle and <b>save</b> lives <b>may return to their</b> original <b>locations</b> on Shabbat.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the statement: <b>If he was within</b> his original <b>limit, it is</b> considered <b>as if he had never left?</b> Given that he has not left his original boundary, it is clear that he remains within his original limit. <b>Rabba said:</b> The mishna <b>is saying as follows: If he was within his</b> original <b>limit, it is</b> considered <b>as if he had never left his house.</b> He is allowed to walk two thousand cubits in each direction from his house.<br>The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that if he remained within his limit, he is considered as if he were in his house. Why is this statement necessary? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that, <b>since he moved</b> from his place with intention to leave his limit and go elsewhere, <b>he moved</b> and nullified his original place of residence. If so, his original place of residence would no longer determine his Shabbat limit, and instead he would have two thousand cubits in each direction from the location where he was standing when he was told that he need not travel. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that it is nonetheless considered as if he had never left his house.<br><b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said</b> that the mishna is <b>saying as follows: If</b> he left his original Shabbat limit, but <b>the</b> new <b>limit</b> of two thousand cubits in each direction <b>that the Sages granted him is subsumed within his</b> original <b>limit,</b> so that if he walks those two thousand cubits, he can return to within his original limit, then <b>it is as if he had never left his</b> original <b>limit,</b> and he may return to his house.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabba and Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya <b>disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Shimi, <b>holds</b> that <b>the subsuming of</b> Shabbat <b>limits,</b> i.e., if one’s original limit is subsumed within the new limit, one may pass from one to the other, <b>is something</b> significant and may be relied upon, whereas this <b>Sage,</b> Rabba, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is nothing</b> significant and cannot be relied upon.<br><b>Abaye said to Rabba: Do you not hold</b> that <b>the subsuming of</b> Shabbat <b>limits is something</b> significant? <b>And what if he established residence in a cave</b> that has entrances at its two ends, which <b>on the inside</b> of the cave <b>is four thousand</b> cubits across, <b>but atop its roof</b> it <b>is less than four thousand cubits</b> across? Is it <b>not the case that he may walk the entire</b> length of the roof <b>and two thousand cubits outside it</b> in either direction? The entire interior of the cave is considered as if it were four cubits, and he is permitted to walk another two thousand cubits in each direction from each of its entrances. Consequently, he is permitted to walk along the roof, two thousand cubits from the eastern entrance in the direction of the western entrance and vice versa. However, since the distance across the roof is less than four thousand cubits, these two limits are subsumed within one another, and he is permitted to walk the entire length of the roof, given that when two limits are subsumed within one another, one may pass from one to the other.<br>Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Do you not distinguish between</b> a case <b>where</b> the person <b>established residence within the airspace of partitions</b> before Shabbat <b>while it was still day,</b> as in the case of the cave, <b>and</b> a case <b>where he did not establish residence within the airspace of partitions</b> before Shabbat <b>while it was still day,</b> as in the case of the mishna? The principle governing the Shabbat limits being subsumed in one another only applies in the former case, where both of the Shabbat limits were established before Shabbat, but not in the latter case, where the two limits were established at different times, one before Shabbat and one on Shabbat.<br>Abaye raised a difficulty: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where he did not acquire</b> his place of residence within those partitions before Shabbat, does the principle governing the subsuming of limits <b>not</b> apply?<br><br></body></html>
