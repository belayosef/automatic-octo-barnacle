Daf 53a<br><br><b>and bridges and monuments</b> over graves <b>in which there is a residence, one extends the measure</b> of that side of the city as though there were other structures <b>opposite them</b> in the adjacent corner of the city. <b>And</b> prior to measuring the Shabbat limit, <b>one renders</b> the city <b>like a square tablet so that it gains the corners,</b> although there are actually no houses in those corners.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a dispute with regard to the mishna’s terminology. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed: <b>One taught</b> that the term in the mishna is <b><i>me’abberin</i>,</b> with the letter <i>ayin</i>, <b>and one taught</b> that the term in the mishna is <b><i>me’abberin</i>,</b> with the letter <i>alef</i>.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>The one who taught <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> explained the term in the sense of <b>limb</b> [<b><i>ever</i></b>] by <b>limb.</b> Determination of the city’s borders involves the addition of limbs to the core section of the city. <b>And the one who taught <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i> explained the term in the sense of <b>a pregnant woman</b> [<b><i>ubbera</i></b>] whose belly protrudes. In similar fashion, all the city’s protrusions are incorporated in its Shabbat limit.<br>Apropos this dispute, the Gemara cites similar disputes between Rav and Shmuel. With regard to <b>the Machpelah Cave,</b> in which the Patriarchs and Matriarchs are buried, <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said:</b> The cave consists of <b>two rooms, one</b> farther <b>in</b> than <b>the other. And one said:</b> It consists of <b>a room and</b> a second <b>story above it.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> this is understandable <b>according to the one who said</b> the cave consists of <b>one</b> room <b>above the other,</b> as <b>that is</b> the meaning of <b>Machpelah, double. However, according to the one who said</b> it consists of <b>two rooms, one</b> farther <b>in</b> than <b>the other,</b> in <b>what</b> sense is it <b>Machpelah?</b> Even ordinary houses contain two rooms.<br>Rather, it is called Machpelah in the sense <b>that it is doubled with</b> the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, who are buried there <b>in pairs.</b> This is similar to the homiletic interpretation of the alternative name for Hebron mentioned in the Torah: <b>“Mamre</b> of <b>Kiryat Ha’Arba,</b> which is Hebron” (Genesis 35:27). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The city is called Kiryat Ha’Arba, the city of four, because it is <b>the city of the four couples</b> buried there: <b>Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca,</b> and <b>Jacob and Leah.</b><br>They disagreed about this verse as well: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> both identified Amraphel with Nimrod. However, <b>one said: Nimrod was his name. And why was his name called Amraphel?</b> It is a contraction of two Hebrew words: <b>As he said [<i>amar</i>]</b> the command <b>and cast [<i>hippil</i>] our father Abraham into the fiery furnace,</b> when Abraham rebelled against and challenged his proclaimed divinity. <b>And one said: Amraphel was his name. And why was his name called Nimrod? Because he caused the entire world to rebel [<i>himrid</i>]</b> against <b>God during his reign.</b><br>They also disagreed about this verse: <b>“There arose a new king over Egypt,</b> who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said:</b> He was <b>actually</b> a <b>new</b> king, <b>and one said:</b> He was in fact the old king, but <b>his decrees were new.</b><br>The Gemara explains. <b>The one who said</b> he was <b>actually</b> a <b>new</b> king based his opinion on the fact <b>that it is written</b> in the verse that he was <b>new. And the one who said that his decrees were new</b> derived his opinion <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is not written: And</b> the king <b>died, and</b> his successor <b>reigned,</b> as it is written, for example, with regard to the kings of Edom (Genesis 36).<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who said that his decrees were new, isn’t it written: “Who knew not Joseph”?</b> If it were the same king, how could he not know Joseph? The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Who knew not Joseph”?</b> It means <b>that he</b> conducted himself <b>like one who did not know Joseph at all.</b><br>The Gemara cites a <b>mnemonic</b> of key words from a series of traditions cited below: <b>Eighteen and twelve we studied, with regard to David, and he will understand.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I spent eighteen days with Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished [<i>Beribbi</i>], and I learned from him only one matter in our Mishna.</b> In the phrase: <b>How does one extend cities,</b> the word <i>me’abberin</i> is spelled <b>with an <i>alef</i>.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished had twelve students, and I spent eighteen days among them, and I learned the heart of each and every one,</b> i.e., the nature and character of each student, <b>and the</b> extent of the <b>wisdom of each and every one?</b> How could Rabbi Yoḥanan say that he learned only one matter?<br>The Gemara answers: It is possible that <b>he learned the heart of each and every one and the wisdom of each and every one,</b> but <b>he did not learn</b> substantive <b>tradition.</b> And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>From</b> the students <b>themselves he learned</b> many things; <b>from</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>himself he did not learn</b> anything beyond that one matter. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: Rabbi Yoḥanan meant to <b>say</b> that he learned only one matter <b>in our Mishna</b> from Rabbi Oshaya, but he learned other matters from him based on <i>baraitot</i> and other sources.<br><b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> about that period: <b>When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Oshaya,</b> it was so crowded with students that <b>we would sit four in each</b> square <b>cubit.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, we would sit six in each</b> square <b>cubit.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> about his teacher: <b>Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished</b> was as great <b>in his generation as Rabbi Meir</b> was <b>in his generation: Just as</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Meir, in his generation his colleagues were unable to fully grasp</b> the profundity of <b>his thinking</b> due to the subtlety of his great mind, <b>so</b> it was with <b>Rabbi Oshaya; his colleagues were unable to fully grasp</b> the profundity of <b>his thinking.</b><br>Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The hearts,</b> i.e., the wisdom, <b>of</b> the <b>early</b> Sages were <b>like the doorway to the Entrance Hall</b> of the Temple, which was twenty by forty cubits, <b>and</b> the hearts <b>of</b> the <b>later</b> Sages <b>were like the doorway to the Sanctuary,</b> which was ten by twenty cubits. <b>And we,</b> i.e., our hearts, <b>are like</b> the <b>eye of a fine needle.</b><br>He explains: The term <b>early</b> Sages is referring to <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the term <b>later</b> Sages is referring to his student, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. Some say</b> that the term <b>early</b> Sages refers to <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua</b> and that the term the <b>later</b> Sages refers to <b>Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished. And we are like</b> the <b>eye of a fine needle.</b><br>On the topic of the steady decline of the generations, <b>Abaye said: And we,</b> as far as our capabilities are concerned, <b>are like a peg in the wall with regard to</b> Torah <b>study.</b> Just as a peg enters a wall with difficulty, our studies penetrate our minds only with difficulty. <b>Rava said: And we are like a finger in wax [<i>kira</i>] with regard to logical reasoning.</b> A finger is not easily pushed into wax, and it extracts nothing from the wax. <b>Rav Ashi said: We are like a finger in a pit with regard to forgetfulness.</b> Just as a finger easily enters a large pit, similarly, we quickly forget our studies.<br>The Gemara continues the discussion relating to study and comprehension, and cites that which <b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>the people of Judea, who were particular in their speech</b> and always made certain that it was both precise and refined, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who were not particular in their speech, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> this <b>matter at all dependent on</b> being <b>particular</b> with one’s language? <b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>the people of Judea, who were precise in their language and</b> who <b>would formulate mnemonics</b> for their studies, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who were not precise in their language and</b> who <b>would not formulate mnemonics, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b><br>Furthermore, with regard to <b>the people of Judea,</b> who <b>studied from one teacher, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them,</b> as their teacher provided them with a consistent approach; however, with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who did not study from one teacher,</b> but rather from several teachers, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them,</b> as it was a combination of the approaches and opinions of a variety of Sages.<br><b>Ravina said:</b> With regard to <b>the people of Judea, who would</b> publicly <b>disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in the coming term so that everyone could prepare and study it in advance (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in the coming term, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b><br>The Gemara relates that King <b>David would disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in advance, whereas <b>Saul would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied. <b>With regard to David, who would disclose the tractate, it is written: “Those who fear You will see me and be glad”</b> (Psalms 119:74), since all were prepared and could enjoy his Torah. <b>With regard to Saul, who would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied, <b>it is written: “And wherever he turned himself</b><br><br>Daf 53b<br><br><b>he did them mischief”</b> (i Samuel 14:47).<br>The Gemara concludes the mention of Saul on a positive note. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, forgave him for that sin,</b> the massacre of Nov, the city of priests? <b>As it is stated</b> that the spirit of Samuel said to him: “And the Lord will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, <b>and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me”</b> (i Samuel 28:19); the phrase <b>“with me”</b> means <b>within my partition</b> together with me in heaven, i.e., on the same level as the righteous prophet Samuel.<br>The Gemara returns to the earlier question with regard to the correct reading of the word <i>me’abberin</i>. <b>Rabbi Abba said: If there is anyone who can ask the people of Judea, who are precise in their language,</b> whether the term in the mishna that <b>we learned</b> is <b><i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> <b>or <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>, he should ask them. Similarly, with regard to the blemishes of a firstborn animal, <b>was</b> the term meaning its hindquarters that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna <b><i>akkuzo</i></b> with an <i>alef</i>, <b>or did we learn <i>akkuzo</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>? <b>They would know.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>One asked</b> the people of Judea, <b>and they said to him: Some teach <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>alef</i>, <b>and some teach <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>. <b>Some teach <i>akkuzo</i></b> with an <i>alef</i>, <b>and some teach <i>akkuzo</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>. Both versions are well founded and neither one is erroneous.<br>Having mentioned that <b>the people of Judea are precise in their speech,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of this? The Gemara answers with an example: <b>As</b> in the case of <b>a certain person from Judea who said to those</b> within earshot: <b>I have a cloak to sell. They said to him: What color is your cloak? He said to them: Like beets on the ground,</b> providing an exceedingly precise description of the exact shade of the cloak, the green tint of beet greens when they first sprout.<br>The Gemara returns to <b>the people of the Galilee, who are not precise in their speech. What is</b> the meaning of this? The Gemara cites examples: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> there was <b>a certain person from the Galilee who would walk and say</b> to people: <b>Who has <i>amar</i>? Who has <i>amar</i>? They said to him: Foolish Galilean,</b> what do you mean? Galileans did not pronounce the guttural letters properly, so it was unclear whether he sought <b>a donkey [<i>ḥamor</i>] to ride, or wine [<i>ḥamar</i>] to drink, wool [<i>amar</i>] to wear, or a lamb [<i>imar</i>] to slaughter.</b> This is an example of the lack of precision in the Galileans’ speech.<br>The Gemara cites another example of the lack of linguistic precision of the Galileans: There was <b>a certain woman who wanted to say to her friend:</b> My neighbor, <b>come and I will feed you milk [<i>ta’i de’okhlikh ḥelba</i>];</b> however, due to the imprecise articulation of her words, <b>she said to her: My neighbor,</b> may a <b>lioness eat you [<i>tokhlikh lavya</i>].</b><br>The Gemara cites another example of the ignorance and incivility of the Galileans: There was <b>a certain woman who came before a judge</b> intending to say: Master, sir [<i>Mari kiri</i>, spelled with a <i>kuf</i>], I had a board, and they stole it from me [<i>tavla havet li ugenavuha mimeni</i>]. But instead <b>she said to him: Master, servant [<i>Mari kiri</i>,</b> spelled with a <i>kaf</i>], <b>I had a beam and they stole you from me</b> [<b><i>tafla havet li ugenavukh min</i></b>]. <b>And it was so</b> large, <b>that when they would hang you upon it, your feet would not reach the ground.</b><br>In contrast to the speech of the Galileans, which indicates ignorance and loutishness, the Gemara cites examples of the clever phraseology of the inhabitants of Judea and the Sages: <b>The maidservant in the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>when she would speak enigmatically,</b> employing euphemistic terminology or in riddles, <b>she would say as follows: The ladle</b> used for drawing wine from the jug <b>is</b> already <b>knocking against</b> the bottom of <b>the jug,</b> i.e., the wine jug is almost empty. <b>Let the eagles fly to their nests,</b> i.e., let the students return home, as there is nothing left for them to drink.<br><b>And when</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>wanted them to sit, she would say to them: Let us remove</b> the stopper <b>from another</b> jug, <b>and let the ladle</b> float <b>in the jug like a ship sailing in the sea.</b><br>The Gemara also relates that <b>when Rabbi Yosei bar Asyan would speak enigmatically, he would say: Prepare for me an ox in judgment on a poor mountain.</b> His method was to construct words by combining words from Aramaic translations of Hebrew words or Hebrew translations of Aramaic words. Ox is <i>tor</i> in Aramaic; judgment is <i>din</i>. Combined they form <i>teradin</i>, beets. Mountain in Hebrew is <i>har</i>, which they pronounced <i>ḥar</i>; poor is <i>dal</i>. Together it spells <i>ḥardal</i>, mustard. Thus, Rabbi Yosei bar Asyan was requesting beets in mustard.<br><b>And when he would inquire about an inn, he would say as follows: This man here is raw; what is this good that there is?</b> The phrase “this man here is raw” is used in a similar syllable-by-syllable translation: man in Hebrew is <i>ish</i>; here is <i>po</i>; this is <i>zeh</i>; and raw is <i>na</i>. All together, they sound like <i>ushpazikhna</i>, i.e., an innkeeper (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). In other words, Rabbi Yosei bar Asyan was asking after the innkeeper.<br><b>When Rabbi Abbahu would speak enigmatically, he would say as follows: Make the coals the color of an <i>etrog</i>; beat the golden ones,</b> i.e., spread out the coals, which redden like gold when they glow; <b>and make me two speakers-in-the-dark,</b> i.e., roosters, which announce the dawn when it is still dark. <b>Some say</b> a slightly different version: <b>And they shall make me in them,</b> on the coals, i.e., roast for me on top of the coals, <b>two speakers-in-the-dark.</b><br>In a similarly clever manner, <b>the Sages said to Rabbi Abbahu: Show us [<i>hatzpinenu</i>] where Rabbi Elai is hiding [<i>tzafun</i>],</b> as we do not know his whereabouts. <b>He said to them: He rejoiced with the latter [<i>aḥaronit</i>] Aharonic [<i>Aharonit</i>] girl; she is lively [<i>eiranit</i>] and kept him awake [<i>vehiniratu</i>].</b><br>There are two ways to understand this cryptic statement: <b>Some say</b> it refers to <b>a woman,</b> i.e., he married a young girl from a priestly family [Aharonic], who is his second [latter] wife, from a village [<i>eiranit</i>], and he is sleeping now because she kept him awake during the night.<br><b>And some say</b> it refers to <b>a tractate.</b> The term girl refers to the tractate; Aharonic indicates that it is a tractate from the order of <i>Kodashim</i>, which deals with the priestly service. The phrase the latter means that it is his latest course of study, and lively alludes to the challenging nature of the subject matter. Since he was awake all night studying, he is presently sleeping.<br>The Gemara continues: <b>They said to Rabbi Elai: Show us where Rabbi Abbahu is hiding,</b> as we do not know where he is. <b>He said to them: He has taken counsel with the one who crowns,</b> i.e., the <i>Nasi</i>, who appoints the Sages, <b>and has gone south</b> [<b><i>hingiv</i></b>] <b>to Mephibosheth,</b> i.e., he has headed to the Sages of the south, referred to here as Mephibosheth, who was King Saul’s grandson and a great Sage of his time.<br>Having discussed the clever speech of various Sages, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said</b> as follows: <b>In</b> all <b>my days, no person defeated me</b> in a verbal encounter <b>except for a woman, a young boy, and a young girl. What is</b> the encounter in which <b>a woman</b> got the better of me? <b>One time I was staying at a certain inn</b> and the hostess <b>prepared me beans. On the first day I ate them and left nothing over,</b> although proper etiquette dictates that one should leave over something on his plate. On the <b>second</b> day I again ate <b>and left nothing over.</b> On the third day <b>she over-salted them</b> so that they were inedible. <b>As soon as I tasted</b> them, <b>I withdrew my hands from them.</b><br><b>She said to me: My Rabbi, why aren’t you eating</b> beans as on the previous days? Not wishing to offend her, <b>I said to her: I have already eaten during the daytime. She said to me: You should have withdrawn your hand from bread</b> and left room for some beans.<br><b>She</b> then <b>said to me: My Rabbi, perhaps you did not leave a remainder</b> of food on your plate <b>on the first</b> days, which is why you are leaving over food today. <b>Isn’t this what the Sages said: One need not leave a remainder in the pot [<i>ilpas</i>], but one must leave a remainder on the plate</b> as an expression of etiquette (<i>Tosafot</i>). This is the incident in which a woman got the better of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya.<br><b>What is</b> the incident with <b>a young girl? One time I was walking along the path, and the path passed through a field, and I was walking on it. A certain young girl said to me: My Rabbi, isn’t this a field?</b> One should not walk through a field, so as not to damage the crops growing there. <b>I said to her: Isn’t it a well-trodden path</b> in the field, across which one is permitted to walk? <b>She said to me: Robbers like you have trodden it.</b> In other words, it previously had been prohibited to walk through this field, and it is only due to people such as you, who paid no attention to the prohibition, that a path has been cut across it. Thus, the young girl defeated Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya in a debate.<br><b>What is</b> the incident with <b>a young boy? One time I was walking along the path, and I saw a young boy sitting at the crossroads. And I said to him: On which path shall we walk</b> in order to get <b>to the city? He said to me: This</b> path <b>is short and long, and that</b> path <b>is long and short. I walked on the</b> path that was <b>short and long. When I approached the city I found that gardens and orchards surrounded it,</b> and I did not know the trails leading through them to the city.<br><b>I went back</b> and met the young boy again and <b>said to him: My son, didn’t you tell me</b> that this way is <b>short? He said to me: And didn’t I tell you</b> that it is also <b>long? I kissed him on his head and said to him: Happy are you, O Israel, for you are all exceedingly wise, from your old to your young.</b><br>Having discussed wise speech and the wisdom of Jewish women, the Gemara cites the following story: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili was walking along the way,</b> and <b>met Berurya. He said to her: On which path shall we walk</b> in order to get <b>to Lod? She said to him: Foolish Galilean, didn’t the Sages say: Do not talk much with women? You should have said</b> your question more succinctly: <b>Which</b> way <b>to Lod?</b><br>The Gemara relates more of Berurya’s wisdom: <b>Berurya came across a certain student who was whispering his studies</b> rather than raising his voice.<br><br></body></html>
