Daf 61a<br><br><b>And the residents of a small city may not walk through an entire large city.</b><br><b>What is the reason</b> for this difference? <b>Is it not because these,</b> the residents of the small city, <b>their measure</b> of two thousand cubits <b>terminated in the middle of the</b> large <b>city,</b> and therefore they may walk only to the end of their two thousand cubits; <b>and these,</b> the residents of the large city, <b>their measure</b> of two thousand cubits <b>terminated at the</b> far <b>end of the</b> small <b>city,</b> allowing them to walk through the entire city as though it were four cubits and complete the two thousand cubit measure of their Shabbat limit on the other side of the city?<br><b>And Rabbi Idi,</b> who said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s statement has no source, may hold that the mishna <b>teaches</b> the two cases with the same formulation. Just as it states: <b>The residents of</b> a large city may walk through an entire small city, it similarly states: <b>The residents of</b> a small city may walk through an entire large city. His version of the mishna did not state that the residents of a small city may not walk through an entire large city. <b>And he establishes</b> the mishna as referring <b>to one who placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> inside the other city. Consequently, that city becomes his Shabbat residence, and he may walk anywhere in that city and an additional two thousand cubits beyond it. <b>But we did not learn</b> anything about <b>one who was measuring</b> two thousand cubits from his Shabbat residence outside the city, in which case it makes a difference whether the entire city is within his two thousand cubits or whether only part of it is within this limit.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> did we <b>not</b> learn in the mishna about one who was measuring? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And as for one who is measuring</b> his Shabbat limit, <b>with regard to whom</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one gives him two thousand cubits,</b> that applies <b>even if the end of his measurement terminates in</b> the middle of <b>a cave?</b> Although a cave has the status of a private domain, he may enter only the part of the cave that is within his two thousand cubits. This case is directly parallel to the case of one whose two thousand cubits end in the middle of a city.<br>The Gemara answers: Although there is a source for the case of one whose limit ends in the middle of a city, <b>it was</b> nevertheless <b>necessary for</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to teach the case where one’s measure ends at <b>the</b> far <b>end of the city,</b> in which case the entire city is regarded as four cubits and the rest of the Shabbat limit is completed on the other side of the city, <b>as we did not learn</b> anything about such a case.<br>With regard to the mishna cited above, <b>Rav Naḥman said: One who teaches</b> the following in the second clause: <b>The residents of</b> a small city may walk through an entire large city, <b>does not err</b> in his rendering of the mishna. <b>And one who teaches: The residents</b> of a small city <b>may not</b> walk through an entire large city, also <b>does not err.</b> Both renderings are plausible.<br>Rav Naḥman explains: <b>One who teaches: The residents of</b> a small city may walk through an entire large city, <b>does not err, as he establishes</b> the mishna as referring <b>to one who places</b> his <i>eiruv</i> inside the other city. <b>And one who teaches: The residents of</b> a small city <b>may not</b> walk through an entire large city also <b>does not err, as he establishes</b> the mishna as referring <b>to one who measures</b> his Shabbat limit and arrives at the city from the outside.<br><b>And</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete and it teaches the following: The residents of a large city may walk</b> through <b>an entire small city, but the residents of a small city may not walk</b> through <b>an entire large city. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It was said <b>with regard to one who was measuring</b> his two thousand cubits from his Shabbat residence. <b>But one who was in the large city and placed his <i>eiruv</i> in the small city,</b> and similarly <b>one who was in the small city and placed his <i>eiruv</i> in the large city, he may walk</b> through <b>the entire</b> city in which he placed his <i>eiruv</i> <b>and beyond it two thousand cubits.</b><br><b>Rav Yosef said that Rami bar Abba said that Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>a city located on the edge of a ravine, if there is a barrier four</b> cubits high <b>in front of it, one measures its</b> Shabbat limit <b>from the edge of the ravine,</b> as it is considered the border of the city. <b>And if</b> there <b>is not</b> a barrier four cubits high in front of it, the Shabbat limit <b>is measured from the entrance of</b> each person’s <b>house,</b> as the city is not considered a permanent settlement.<br><b>Abaye said to him: You told us with regard to</b> this case that a <b>barrier four cubits</b> high is required. <b>What is different</b> about this case that it requires a barrier that is higher <b>than all other barriers,</b> which must reach a height of only <b>four</b> handbreadths?<br><b>He said to him: There, use</b> of the place <b>is not frightening; here, use</b> of the place <b>is frightening.</b> Generally, partitions serve a symbolic function, and therefore it is sufficient for the partition to be four handbreadths high. In this case, however, it is frightening to stand along the edge of the ravine without a protective barrier, and therefore a barrier four cubits high must be constructed for the safety of the residents.<br><b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I</b> derive to <b>say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted the residents of Geder,</b> situated at the top of a slope, <b>to descend</b> on Shabbat <b>to Ḥamtan,</b> situated at the bottom of the slope, but <b>the residents of Ḥamtan may not ascend to Geder. What is the reason? Is it not because these,</b> the inhabitants of Geder, <b>constructed a barrier</b> at the lower edge of their city, <b>and these,</b> the members of Ḥamtan, <b>did not construct a barrier</b> at the upper edge of their city? Consequently, the residents of Geder measured their Shabbat limit from their barrier, and Ḥamtan was included in their two thousand cubits. The residents of Ḥamtan had to measure their Shabbat limits from their homes, and therefore Geder was not within their two thousand cubit limit.<br>The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> This ruling was issued not due to their respective Shabbat limits, but rather because <b>the residents of Geder would assault [<i>metatreg</i>] the residents of Ḥamtan. And what</b> does it mean that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted</b> the residents of Geder to descend to Ḥamtan, but not vice versa? <b>He instituted</b> this. In other words, this was not a halakhic ruling, but rather an ordinance instituted to protect the public welfare and prevent fighting.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>Shabbat</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi instituted this ordinance only for Shabbat and not for the rest of the week? The Gemara answers: <b>Drunkenness is common on</b> Shabbat, when people eat to their heart’s content. Therefore, there is a greater chance of violent behavior.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>When</b> the residents of Geder <b>go to</b> Ḥamtan, <b>they will assault</b> the residents there; of what use, then, is this ordinance? The Gemara answers, citing a popular saying: <b>A dog</b> that is <b>not in its place will not bark for seven years.</b> On its own turf, a dog barks readily, but it becomes scared in unfamiliar surroundings and remains silent. Similarly, the people of Geder are not nearly as bold when they visit Ḥamtan as they are in their own town.<br>The Gemara asks: If so, we should be concerned about the reverse scenario, that <b>now too, the residents of Ḥamtan,</b> in their home territory, <b>will</b> take revenge and <b>assault the residents of Geder.</b> The Gemara answers: The people of Geder <b>would not be submissive to such an extent.</b> While visiting Ḥamtan, they would not initiate fights, but they would certainly fight back if they were attacked. Consequently, the people of Ḥamtan would not dare initiate hostilities with them. Therefore, there is no concern about the safety of either group.<br><b>Rav Safra said:</b> Geder <b>was a city shaped like a bow,</b> whose two ends were separated by less than four thousand cubits. The empty space of the bow was viewed as though it were filled with houses, and its Shabbat limit was measured from the imaginary bowstring stretched between the two ends of the bow. Consequently, Ḥamtan was included in its Shabbat limit, and the residents of Geder were permitted to go there on Shabbat. With regard to the inhabitants of Ḥamtan, however, that same area between the ends of Geder was viewed as empty space, and therefore the houses of Geder along the arc of the bow were beyond their Shabbat limit.<br><b>Rav Dimi bar Ḥinana said:</b> The people of Geder were <b>residents of a large city, and</b> the people of Ḥamtan were <b>residents of a small city.</b> Consequently, the residents of the large city, Geder, could walk through all of Ḥamtan, the small city; but the residents of Ḥamtan could walk only through part of Geder, as explained previously.<br><b>Rav Kahana taught it that way,</b> as stated previously; whereas <b>Rav Tavyomi taught it</b> more concisely, in <b>this way: Rav Safra and Rav Dimi bar Ḥinana</b> disagreed about the matter. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> Geder <b>was a city shaped like a bow; and one</b> of them <b>said:</b> The people of Ḥamtan <b>were residents of a small city and</b> the people of Geder <b>were residents of a large city.</b><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The residents of a large city may walk through an entire small city, and the residents of a small city may walk through an entire large city,</b> even if part of it is located more than two thousand cubits from their city. <b>How so? One who was in a large city and placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a small city,</b> or one who was <b>in a small city and placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a large city, may walk</b> through <b>the entire</b> city in which he placed his <i>eiruv</i> <b>and</b> another <b>two thousand cubits beyond it,</b> as the entire city is considered as though it were only four cubits.<br><b>Rabbi Akiva says: He has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>,</b> as the actual area of the city is included in the calculation. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> the Rabbis: Do <b>you not concede to me</b> that <b>one who places his <i>eiruv</i> in a cave has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>,</b> and that consequently the entire cave is not considered as merely four cubits?<br>The Rabbis <b>said to him: When</b> does this apply? <b>When</b> the cave <b>has no residents. But</b> if <b>it has residents,</b> it is considered as though it were only four cubits, and <b>one may walk</b> through <b>all of it and</b> another <b>two thousand cubits beyond it. Consequently,</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> placed <b>inside</b> a cave <b>is</b> sometimes <b>more lenient than</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing an <i>eiruv</i> placed in the area <b>above</b> the cave. If one places his <i>eiruv</i> inside a cave that has residents, he has two thousand cubits beyond the cave; if he places it above the cave, where there are no residents, he has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>And as for one who is measuring</b> his Shabbat limit, with regard to whom the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one gives him two thousand cubits,</b> that measurement applies <b>even if the end of his measurement terminates in</b> the middle of <b>a cave.</b> He may not walk further into the cave, even if the cave is inhabited.<br><br>Daf 61b<br><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said:</b> If <b>one established his Shabbat residence in a desolate city</b> whose walls are still standing, <b>according to the Rabbis he may walk through all of it</b> as though it were four cubits, <b>and</b> he may walk an additional <b>two thousand cubits beyond it.</b> If, however, <b>he</b> merely <b>placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a desolate city, he has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Rabbis distinguish between one who establishes his Shabbat residence by actually being present in that location at the onset of Shabbat and one who does so by placing his <i>eiruv</i> there before Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Whether he established his Shabbat residence</b> through his physical presence <b>or he</b> merely <b>placed his <i>eiruv</i></b> there, <b>he may walk through all of it and</b> another <b>two thousand cubits beyond it.</b><br>The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the mishna. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> the Rabbis: Do <b>you not concede to me</b> that <b>one who places his <i>eiruv</i> in a cave has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>? They said to him: When</b> does this apply? <b>When</b> the cave <b>has no residents.</b> Consequently, <b>when it has no residents</b> the Rabbis <b>concede to</b> Rabbi Akiva that one has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>. This contradicts Rabbi Elazar’s assertion that, according to the Rabbis, even if one places his <i>eiruv</i> in the abandoned city, he may walk through all of it and another two thousand cubits beyond it.<br>The Gemara responds: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the qualification that it <b>has no residents?</b> It means that the place <b>is not fit for residence.</b> If, however, the city is suitable for habitation, it is considered like four cubits even if it is currently uninhabited.<br><b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another difficulty from the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one established his Shabbat residence</b> through his physical presence <b>in a city, even</b> if <b>it is as large as Antioch,</b> or <b>in a cave, even</b> if <b>it is</b> particularly large, <b>like the Cave of Zedekiah, king of Judah, he may walk through all of it and</b> another <b>two thousand cubits beyond it.</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a city</b> that is <b>similar to</b> that of <b>a cave: Just as a cave is</b> presumably <b>desolate,</b> i.e., uninhabited, <b>so too the city</b> must be one that <b>is desolate. And</b> only in the case where <b>he established his Shabbat residence</b> through his physical presence would <b>yes,</b> this <i>halakha</i> apply; <b>but</b> if he merely <b>placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> there, <b>no,</b> he may not measure his two thousand cubits from the edge of the city.<br>The Gemara continues clarifying the <i>baraita</i>: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, why</b> did the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically</b> teach the case of a <b>desolate</b> city? <b>Even</b> if it was <b>inhabited,</b> the same <i>halakha</i> should <b>also</b> apply, as Rabbi Akiva holds that even if one placed his <i>eiruv</i> in an inhabited city, he has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>. <b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? And</b> nonetheless, <b>the reason is that one established his Shabbat residence</b> through his physical presence. In such a case, <b>yes,</b> one may walk through the entire city and another two thousand cubits beyond it. <b>But</b> if one merely <b>placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> there, he would <b>not</b> be permitted to walk more than two thousand cubits from his <i>eiruv</i>, which would contradict the opinion of Rabbi Elazar.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument and argues that the initial inference was incorrect. <b>Do not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a city</b> that is <b>similar to a cave. Rather, say</b> that it is referring to <b>a cave</b> that is <b>similar to a city: Just as the city is</b> presumably <b>inhabited, so too the cave</b> must be one that is <b>inhabited.</b> The <i>baraita</i> is then in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that if one merely places his <i>eiruv</i> in the cave, <b>he has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <i>eiruv</i>.</b> However, if <b>one established his Shabbat residence</b> there through his physical presence, even Rabbi Akiva <b>concedes</b> that the entire cave is considered as though it were four cubits, and he may walk two thousand cubits beyond the cave.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies even to a cave <b>like the Cave of Zedekiah,</b> which was uninhabited? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a cave that is <b>like the Cave of Zedekiah</b> in one respect <b>and not like the Cave of Zedekiah</b> in other respects. It is <b>like the Cave of Zedekiah</b> in that the cave is as <b>large</b> as that one. <b>And</b> it is <b>not</b> exactly <b>like the Cave of Zedekiah, as there,</b> with regard to Zedekiah’s cave, it was <b>desolate, and here</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a cave that is <b>inhabited.</b><br>The Gemara relates that <b>Mar Yehuda</b> once <b>found the residents of Mavrakhta placing their <i>eiruvin</i> in the synagogue of Beit Agovar. He said to them: Place</b> your <i>eiruv</i> <b>farther</b> into the synagogue, <b>so that more will be permitted to you,</b> as the Shabbat limit is measured from the spot where the <i>eiruv</i> is deposited. Mar Yehuda holds that even when an <i>eiruv</i> is placed in an inhabited city, the two thousand cubits are measured from the location of the <i>eiruv</i> rather than from the edge of the city.<br><b>Rava said to him: Argumentative one! With regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i>, nobody is concerned about this</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. Consequently, no matter where one places his <i>eiruv</i> in a city, the entire city is considered as though it were four cubits, and he is permitted to walk two thousand cubits beyond the edge of the city.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who resides with a gentile in</b> the same <b>courtyard, or</b> one who lives in the same courtyard <b>with one who does not accept</b> the principle of <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> even though he is not a gentile, such as a Samaritan [<i>Kuti</i>], <b>this</b> person <b>renders it prohibited for him</b> to carry from his own house into the courtyard or from the courtyard into his house, unless he rents this person’s rights in the courtyard, as will be explained below.<br><b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Actually,</b> the gentile <b>does not render it prohibited</b> for one to carry, <b>unless there are two Jews</b> living in the same courtyard who themselves would <b>prohibit one another</b> from carrying if there were no <i>eiruv</i>. In such a case, the presence of the gentile renders the <i>eiruv</i> ineffective. However, if only one Jew lives there, the gentile does not render it prohibited for him to carry in the courtyard.<br><b>Rabban Gamliel said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain Sadducee who lived with us in</b> the same <b>alleyway in Jerusalem,</b> who renounced his rights to the alleyway before Shabbat. <b>And Father said to us: Hurry and take out</b> your <b>utensils to the alleyway</b> to establish possession of it, <b>before he</b> changes his mind and <b>takes out</b> his own utensils so as to reclaim his rights, in which case <b>he would render it prohibited for you to</b> use the entire alleyway.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Rabban Gamliel’s father spoke to them <b>with a different formulation,</b> saying: <b>Hurry and do</b> whatever <b>you must do in the alleyway</b> prior to Shabbat, <b>before he takes out</b> his utensils <b>and renders it prohibited for you to</b> use the alleyway. In other words, you may not bring out utensils to the alleyway at all on Shabbat, as the institution of an <i>eiruv</i> cannot be used in the neighborhood of a Sadducee. This is because, even if he renounced his rights to the alleyway, he can always retract and reclaim them.<br><br></body></html>
