Daf 71a<br><br>In such a case, <b>even though a different Jew took possession of</b> the convert’s <b>property,</b> the one who acquires it renders carrying <b>prohibited.</b> If, however, he died <b>after nightfall, even though a different Jew did not take possession of</b> his property, <b>it,</b> i.e., carrying, <b>is not prohibited,</b> for carrying had already been permitted on that Shabbat.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: The <i>baraita</i> <b>itself is difficult. You</b> first <b>said:</b> If the convert died <b>while it was still day, even though a different Jew took possession of</b> his property, the latter renders carrying prohibited, which implies that <b>it is not necessary</b> to say so <b>where</b> another Jew <b>did not take possession of</b> the property, for in such a case it is certainly prohibited. But this is incorrect. <b>On the contrary,</b> in a case <b>where</b> a different person <b>did not take possession of</b> the property, <b>it is</b> certainly <b>not prohibited,</b> for in such a case the convert’s property is ownerless and there is nobody to render carrying in the courtyard prohibited.<br><b>Rav Pappa said: Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: <b>Even though</b> a different Jew <b>did not take possession of</b> it. The Gemara raises a difficulty: How can it be corrected in this manner? <b>But doesn’t it teach: Even though he took possession of</b> it?<br>The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the convert died while it was still day, then <b>even though</b> a different Jew <b>did not take possession of</b> the property <b>while it was still day but</b> only <b>after nightfall, since he had</b> the possibility <b>of taking possession</b> of it <b>while it was still day,</b> the person who acquires it renders carrying <b>prohibited.</b> If, however, the convert died <b>after nightfall, even though a different Jew did not take possession of</b> his property, <b>it does not render</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to carry.<br>The Gemara now considers the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: If the convert died after nightfall, <b>even though a different Jew did not take possession of</b> his property, carrying is not prohibited. This implies that <b>it is not necessary</b> to say so <b>where</b> another Jew <b>did take possession of</b> the property, for in such a case it is certainly not prohibited. But, <b>on the contrary, where</b> a different person <b>takes possession of</b> the property, <b>he</b> renders carrying <b>prohibited.</b><br><b>Rav Pappa said: Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: <b>Even though</b> a different Jew <b>took possession of</b> it. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: Even though he did not take possession of</b> it? The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the convert died after nightfall, <b>even though</b> a different Jew <b>took possession of</b> his property <b>after nightfall, since he did not have</b> the possibility <b>of taking possession</b> of it <b>while it was still day, he does not</b> render carrying <b>prohibited.</b><br>After explaining the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara proceeds to clarify the issue at hand: <b>In any event, the first clause is teaching</b> that the person who acquires the convert’s property <b>renders</b> carrying <b>prohibited;</b> but <b>why does he render</b> carrying <b>prohibited? Let him renounce</b> his rights in the domain like an heir. The implication then is that he does not have the option of renunciation, in contrast to the opinion of Rav Naḥman.<br>Rav Naḥman replied: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>prohibits that it teaches</b> here? It means he renders carrying prohibited <b>until he renounces</b> his rights, but renunciation is effective.<br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who is the <i>tanna</i> of the</b> problematic <b><i>baraitot</i></b> that imply that an heir cannot renounce rights, and from which objections were brought against Rav Naḥman? <b>It is Beit Shammai, who say</b> that <b>there is no renunciation of rights on Shabbat</b> at all, even for the owner of the property. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>When may one give away rights</b> in a domain? <b>Beit Shammai say: While it is still day. And Beit Hillel say:</b> Even <b>after nightfall.</b><br>With regard to this dispute itself, <b>Ulla said: What is the reason of Beit Hillel</b> that one may renounce rights even after nightfall? This should be considered an act of acquisition, which is prohibited on Shabbat. He explains: <b>It is comparable to one who says: Turn toward the high-quality ones.</b> If a person sets aside <i>teruma</i> from another person’s produce without the latter’s knowledge, and when the owner finds out he says: Why did you set aside this produce? Turn toward the high-quality ones, i.e., you should have gone to find better produce to use as <i>teruma</i>, then the <i>teruma</i> that was separated is considered <i>teruma</i>, provided there was indeed quality produce in that place. The reason is that the owner has demonstrated his retroactive acquiescence to the other person’s setting aside of <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, the latter is considered his agent for this purpose. The same applies to our issue. If a person intended to permit both himself and others to carry in a courtyard by means of establishing an <i>eiruv</i> but forgot to do so, by renouncing his rights after nightfall, he retroactively makes plain his desire that his domain should be mingled with that of his neighbors. What he then does on Shabbat is not a complete action, but merely a demonstration of his intentions.<br><b>Abaye said:</b> This explanation is unsatisfactory, as when <b>a gentile dies on Shabbat, what</b> connection <b>is there to</b> the concept: <b>Turn toward the high-quality ones?</b> When a gentile dies on Shabbat, his Jewish neighbors may renounce their rights in the courtyard to each other and thus render carrying in the courtyard permitted, even though such renunciation would have been ineffective prior to his passing. Consequently, it cannot be said that it works retroactively.<br><b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects Ulla’s explanation and states that <b>here they disagree over the following: Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>renunciation of a domain is</b> equivalent to <b>acquisition of a domain, and acquisition of a domain is prohibited on Shabbat. And Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>it is merely withdrawal from a domain, and withdrawal from a domain seems well on Shabbat,</b> i.e., it is permitted. As such, there is no reason to prohibit renunciation as a form of acquisition, which is prohibited as a part of a decree against conducting commerce on Shabbat.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a homeowner was in partnership with his neighbors, with this</b> one <b>in wine and with that</b> one <b>in wine, they need not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> for due to their authentic partnership they are considered to be one household, and no further partnership is required.<br>If, however, he was in partnership <b>with this</b> one <b>in wine and with that</b> one <b>in oil, they must establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> As they are not partners in the same item, they are not all considered one partnership. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, i.e., even if he partners with his neighbors in different items, <b>they need not establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that one who is in partnership in wine with both his neighbors need not establish an <i>eiruv</i> applies only if their wine is <b>in one vessel. Rava said:</b> The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> If he was in partnership <b>with this one in wine and with the</b> other <b>one in oil, they must establish an <i>eiruv</i>. Granted, if you say</b> that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna deals <b>with one vessel, and the latter clause</b> deals <b>with two vessels,</b> one of wine and one of oil, <b>it is well. But, if you say</b> that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna speaks <b>of two vessels, and the latter clause</b> also speaks <b>of two vessels, what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if it is <b>wine and wine or wine and oil?</b> The <i>halakha</i> should be the same in both cases.<br><b>Abaye said to him:</b> This is no proof, and the first clause can be referring to a case where the wine was in separate vessels as well. The difference is that <b>wine and wine is suitable for mixing</b> together, and therefore can be considered a single unit even if divided into two containers. <b>Wine and oil,</b> however, <b>are not suitable for mixing.</b><br>We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case, where they are partners in wine alone, <b>and that</b> case, where the partnerships are in wine and oil, <b>they need not establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara poses a question: Did he say this <b>even if</b> the partnership is <b>with this one in wine and with the other one in oil?</b> But these are not suitable for mixing. <b>Rabba said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a courtyard</b> positioned <b>between two alleyways, and Rabbi Shimon</b> follows <b>his</b> usual line of <b>reasoning.</b><br><b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to</b> the case of <b>three courtyards that open into one another and</b> also <b>open into a public domain. If the two outer</b> courtyards each <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with the middle one, it is permitted</b> for residents of the middle one to carry <b>with</b> the two outer ones, <b>and it is permitted</b> for residents of the two outer ones to carry <b>with</b> the middle one. <b>However, it is prohibited</b> for the residents of <b>the two outer</b> courtyards to carry <b>with each other,</b> as they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with each other. This teaches that the residents of one courtyard can establish an <i>eiruv</i> with a courtyard on each side, and need not choose between them. Here too, the residents of the courtyard can participate in an <i>eiruv</i> with both alleyways, one by means of wine and the other by means of oil.<br><b>Abaye said to him: Are</b> the cases really <b>comparable? There it teaches: It is prohibited</b> for the residents of <b>the two outer</b> courtyards to carry with each other, whereas <b>here it teaches: They need not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> indicating that it is permitted for residents of all three domains to carry with each other.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the subject of the phrase <b>they need not establish an <i>eiruv</i>?</b> It refers to the <b>neighbors together with the homeowner,</b> i.e., the residents of the courtyards that open into each of the alleyways with the resident of the courtyard in the middle. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the neighbors with each other,</b> i.e., if the residents of the two alleyways wish to be permitted to carry with each other, <b>they must establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> and place it in the middle courtyard.<br><br>Daf 71b<br><br><b>And Rav Yosef said:</b> In fact we are dealing here with a single alleyway, and <b>Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis disagree about the</b> same point of <b>dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna: If <i>teruma</i> <b>oil was floating on the surface of wine, and one who immersed during the day, touched the oil, he disqualified only the oil alone.</b> However, he did not disqualify the wine, because it is considered separate from the oil. Only the oil is disqualified, and it does not render other items ritually impure. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: They are both connected to each other</b> and are considered as one, so the wine is also ritually impure.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>The</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis</b> in our mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the other mishna, who maintain that wine and oil are not connected and therefore cannot be used together in an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who holds that wine and oil are connected, and may be used together in an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case, of wine and wine, <b>and that</b> case, of wine and oil, <b>they must establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara expresses wonder: Did he say this <b>even</b> if the partnership is <b>with this one in wine and</b> also <b>with the</b> other <b>one in wine?</b> Why should these partnerships not be sufficient to consider the items merged?<br><b>Rabba said:</b> If they partnered in the following manner, such that <b>this one came with his</b> wine-filled <b>jug and poured</b> its contents into a barrel, <b>and the</b> other <b>one came with his jug and poured</b> his wine into that same barrel, <b>everyone agrees that it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> even if they did not act specifically for that purpose.<br><b>Where they disagree</b> is in the case <b>where they bought a barrel of wine in partnership. Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai holds: There is no</b> principle of <b>retroactive clarification,</b> i.e., there is no halakhic assumption that the undetermined halakhic status of items can be retroactively clarified. Consequently, after the wine is consumed, it is not possible to clarify retroactively which portion of the wine belonged to each person. Therefore, they cannot each be said to own a particular part of the wine, which renders it unfit for an <i>eiruv</i>. <b>But the Rabbis hold that there is retroactive clarification,</b> and therefore they may rely on this partnership to establish an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rav Yosef said</b> that this dispute should be understood differently, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai and the Rabbis disagree about</b> whether one may <b>rely on a merging</b> of an alleyway <b>instead of an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., whether the merging of an alleyway to permit carrying in the alleyway, exempts the courtyards that open into the alleyway from having to establish an <i>eiruv</i> for the purpose of carrying from one courtyard to the other.<br><b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai, <b>holds</b> that one <b>may not rely</b> on it in that case, as carrying in the courtyards requires specifically an <i>eiruv</i>, and the merging of alleyways is insufficient. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>maintains</b> that one <b>may rely</b> on and use the merging of alleyways to permit carrying between the courtyards as well.<br><b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this,</b> that this is the subject of their dispute? <b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> which will be detailed later, that one may not rely on a merging of alleyways instead of an <i>eiruv</i>. <b>And Rav Beruna said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai,</b> that in both cases they must establish an <i>eiruv</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> he ruled in this manner? <b>Is it not because the rationale</b> for both rulings is <b>one</b> and the same?<br><b>Abaye said to him: But if it is one reason, why do I</b> need <b>two rulings?</b> On the contrary, it would be enough to rule in one case, from which we could infer the other as well. Rav Yosef replied: There is nevertheless a reason for both rulings, as <b>this</b> comes to <b>teach us that we do not act in accordance with two stringencies</b> of one <i>tanna</i> <b>in</b> matters of <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> Had Rav ruled only in accordance with Rabbi Meir, we would have known only that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion with regard to one specific detail of the case. He therefore ruled in accordance with two Sages: Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai with regard to a merging of alleyways with wine, and Rabbi Meir with regard to a merging of alleyways with bread. Each is stringent with regard to a different detail of the case.<br>Having mentioned Rabbi Meir, the Gemara now asks: <b>What</b> is the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, and what</b> is the statement of <b>the Rabbis? As it was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with bread between courtyards</b> that open to one another, <b>but if one wanted to establish an <i>eiruv</i> with wine, one</b> may <b>not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> in that manner. <b>One</b> may <b>merge</b> the courtyards that open <b>into an alleyway with wine, and if one wanted to establish a merging</b> of alleyways <b>with bread, one</b> may <b>merge</b> the courtyards of alleyways in this manner.<br>Why <b>does</b> one <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> between courtyards and</b> also <b>merge</b> the courtyards that open <b>into an alleyway?</b> It is so <b>as not to cause the</b> halakhic <b>category of <i>eiruv</i> to be forgotten by the children, as</b> if a merging of alleyways alone were used, the children would later <b>say: Our fathers never established an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> Therefore, an <i>eiruv</i> is established for educational purposes; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> One may <b>either establish an <i>eiruv</i> or merge</b> alleyways.<br><b>Rabbi Naḥumi and Rabba disagreed about</b> this issue. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> In the case <b>of bread,</b> which may be used both for an <i>eiruv</i> and for a merging of alleyways, <b>everyone agrees that one,</b> either an <i>eiruv</i> or a merging of alleyways, <b>is enough. When they disagree</b> in the case <b>of wine,</b> which may be used only for a merging of alleyways but not for an <i>eiruv</i>, Rabbi Meir maintains that an <i>eiruv</i> is also necessary, while the Rabbis maintain that it is not required.<br><br></body></html>
