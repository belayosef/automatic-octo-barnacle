Daf 22a<br><br><b>who, for</b> the Torah’s <b>sake, gets up early</b> in the morning [<i>shaḥar</i>] <b>and stays late</b> in the evening [<i>erev</i>] <b>in the study hall. Rabba said: In him who, for</b> the Torah’s <b>sake, blackens his face like a raven,</b> i.e., who fasts and deprives himself for the sake of Torah study.<br><b>Rava said: In him who makes himself cruel to his sons and</b> other <b>members of his household like a raven</b> for the sake of Torah. This <b>was the case with Rav Adda bar Mattana,</b> who <b>was</b> about to <b>go to the study hall</b> to learn Torah, and <b>his wife said to him: What shall I do for your children?</b> How shall I feed them in your absence? <b>He said to her: Are all the rushes [<i>kurmei</i>] in the marsh</b> already <b>gone?</b> If there is no other bread, let them eat food prepared from rushes.<br>The Gemara proceeds to interpret a different verse homiletically: <b>“And He repays them that hate Him to His face to destroy them;</b> He will not be slack to him that hates Him, He will repay him to his face” (Deuteronomy 7:10). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it</b> would <b>be impossible to utter it,</b> in deference to God, for it could be understood, <b>as it were, like a person who bears a burden on his face, and wishes to throw it off.</b> Written slightly differently, the verse could have been understood as implying that God is unable, as it were, to bear the situation, but must punish the wicked immediately.<br>With regard to the words <b>“He shall not be slack to him that hates Him,” Rabbi Ila said: He will not be slack</b> in bringing punishment <b>to him that hates Him, but He will be slack</b> in rewarding <b>those who are absolutely righteous,</b> as the reward of the righteous does not arrive immediately, but only in the World-to-Come.<br><b>And that</b> is <b>what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And you shall keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments <b>which I command you today to do them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:11)? It means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them,</b> in this world, <b>and tomorrow</b> is <b>not</b> the time <b>to do them,</b> as there is no obligation or opportunity to fulfill mitzvot in the World-to-Come. Furthermore, it means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them,</b> but only <b>tomorrow,</b> in the ultimate future, is the time <b>to receive reward for</b> doing <b>them.</b><br>In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Ḥaggai said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed: The Lord, the Lord, merciful and gracious, <b>long-suffering [<i>erekh appayim</i>],</b> and abundant in love and truth” (Exodus 34:6)? Why does it say “<i>erekh appayim</i>,” using a plural form? <b>It should have</b> said <b><i>erekh af</i>,</b> using the singular form.<br>What this means is that God is long-suffering in two ways: He is <b>long-suffering toward the righteous,</b> i.e., He delays payment of their reward; and He is also <b>long-suffering toward the wicked,</b> i.e., He does not punish them immediately.<br>The mishna stated that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The area may be expanded <b>up to</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> an area of five thousand square cubits. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages in clarification of this statement: <b>Did he speak</b> of the area of <b>the cistern</b> itself <b>and</b> that enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> that the total area enclosed by the upright boards may be expanded up to, but may not exceed, an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>? <b>Or perhaps he spoke</b> of the area of <b>the cistern without</b> that enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> that the cistern itself may be expanded up to an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>? In that case, the total area enclosed by the boards could exceed an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.<br>The underlying rationale of each side of this dilemma is as follows: Does one <b>fix his eyes on his cistern,</b> keeping in mind that the partition is made because of it, <b>and</b> therefore, since the area of the cistern is not greater than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>we do not decree lest he come to carry</b> also <b>in an enclosure [<i>karpef</i>],</b> an enclosed storage space behind the house that was not originally surrounded by a fence for the purpose of residence, even when it is <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>?</b><br><b>Or perhaps a person fixes his eyes on his partition,</b> and does not pay attention to the cistern, but only to the area enclosed by the partition. <b>And</b> in this case <b>we</b> do <b>decree, lest he come to confuse</b> this case <b>with</b> that of <b>a <i>karpef</i></b> that is <b>larger than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> and come to carry there, because of the similarity between them.<br>In order to resolve this question, the Gemara cites a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How close</b> may the boards be to the well? They may be <b>as</b> close as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow. And how far may they be</b> from the well? The enclosed area may be expanded <b>even</b> to the area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i> and even two <i>beit kor</i>,</b> provided that one adds more upright boards or increases their size so as to reduce the size of the gaps between them. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Up to an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to enclose the area in this manner; <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is prohibited.</b><br>The other Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do you not concede with regard to a pen, a stable, a backyard, and a courtyard, that even one</b> the size <b>of five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>of ten <i>beit kor</i> is permitted</b> for use?<br>Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> A distinction can be made between the cases, for <b>this,</b> the wall surrounding the pen, the stable or the yard, is a proper <b>partition,</b> and hence it is permitted to carry in them even if they are more than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>. However, <b>these are</b> only upright <b>boards,</b> and they only allow one to carry if the area they enclose is not more than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A cistern</b> the length of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> by</b> the width of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> is permitted, and they only said to distance</b> the upright boards from the cistern <b>as</b> much as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow.</b><br>The Gemara tries to draw an inference from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar spoke</b> only <b>of the cistern</b> itself <b>and not</b> of the upright <b>boards,</b> we can <b>infer</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda spoke of</b> both <b>the cistern</b> itself <b>and</b> the area enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: It is <b>not so.</b> When <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> said that the area may be expanded up to an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>he was,</b> in fact, <b>speaking of</b> the area of <b>the cistern without</b> that which is enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>If so, that is</b> exactly what <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> said. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical halakhic difference <b>between them</b> in a case where the enclosed area is <b>long and narrow.</b> Rabbi Yehuda permits using it, whereas Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar requires that the area be square.<br>The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> enclosed <b>space that is used as a dwelling, such as a pen, a stable, a backyard, or a courtyard,</b> even if it lacks a roof and <b>even</b> if the structure has the area of <b>five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permitted</b> to carry in it.<br><b>And</b> with regard to <b>any dwelling that is used for the space</b> outside it, i.e., whose partitions were arranged not so that it could be lived in, but for the sake of the field or yard outside, <b>such as field huts,</b> if its area was <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to carry in it; but if its area was <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is prohibited</b> to do so.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the path of the public domain passes through</b> the area of the upright boards surrounding a well <b>and obstructs it, one must divert</b> the path <b>to the sides,</b> so that the public will circumvent the enclosed area; otherwise, the partition is invalid and the enclosed area cannot be regarded as a private domain. <b>And the Rabbis say: One need not</b> divert the path of the public domain, for the partition is valid even if many people pass through it.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both said: Here,</b> the Rabbis <b>informed you of the strength of partitions;</b> although a path of the public domain passes through the partitions and the partitions do not constitute effective barriers, they are still strong enough to allow one to carry.<br>The Gemara wishes to clarify the meaning of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: Did he mean <b>here</b> that the Rabbis expressed this idea, <b>and he agrees</b> with them that a public thoroughfare does not invalidate a partition? <b>Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> even though it is walled, <b>were it not for the fact that its doors are locked at night, one would be liable for</b> carrying in <b>it</b> on Shabbat <b>because</b> its thoroughfares are regarded <b>as the public domain?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that a partition is not strong enough to overcome the passage of many people.<br><b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be understood as follows: <b>Here,</b> the Rabbis expressed this idea, although <b>he does not agree</b> with them.<br>The Gemara <b>raised a contradiction between</b> this statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> and another statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and raised a contradiction</b> between this statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> and another statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b><br>The other statements are <b>as it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one had two houses on the two sides of the public domain,</b> and he wishes to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <b>he may place a side post from here,</b> perpendicular to the public domain, <b>and</b> an additional <b>side post from here,</b> on the other side of the public domain, <b>or</b> he may place a cross <b>beam from here,</b> from one end of one house to the end of the house opposite it, <b>and</b> another cross <b>beam from here,</b> from the other side of the house, <b>and carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in</b> the area <b>between them</b> because the two added partitions turn the area in the middle into a private domain. The Rabbis <b>said to him: One cannot make the public domain fit</b> for carrying <b>by</b> means of <b>an <i>eiruv</i> in this manner,</b> i.e., by means of a side post alone, when many people continue to walk through the public thoroughfare in the middle.<br>Consequently, there is <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b><br>The Gemara answers: Between one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> there is <b>no contradiction,</b> because one can differentiate between them. <b>There,</b> in the case of the two houses, <b>there are two proper partitions,</b> for the houses are real partitions, and two partitions suffice to establish a separate domain. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of the upright boards, <b>there are not two proper partitions,</b> for the upright boards are not real partitions.<br>Between one statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> and the other statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> there is <b>also no contradiction,</b> as <b>here,</b> with regard to the upright boards, <b>there is a nominal</b> set <b>of four partitions;</b> on all four sides side there are at least two cubits of some form of partition, so the cistern is regarded as enclosed by four partitions. However, <b>there,</b> with regard to the two houses, <b>there is not a nominal</b> set <b>of four partitions.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In <b>Eretz Yisrael one is not liable for</b> carrying in <b>the public domain. Rav Dimi sat and recited this <i>halakha</i>. Abaye said to Rav Dimi: What is the reason</b> underlying this ruling?<br><br>Daf 22b<br><br><b>If you say</b> this law <b>because</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>is surrounded by the Ladder of Tyre on one side and the slope of Gader on the other side,</b> each formation being over ten handbreadths high and constituting a valid partition, then <b>Babylonia,</b> which <b>is also surrounded by</b> the <b>Euphrates</b> River <b>on one side and</b> the <b>Tigris</b> River <b>on the other side,</b> should not be considered a public domain either. Moreover, <b>the entire world is also surrounded by the ocean,</b> and therefore there should be no public domain anywhere in the world. Rather, <b>perhaps you spoke of the ascents and descents</b> of Eretz Yisrael, which are not easy to traverse and hence should not have the status of a public domain?<br>Rav Dimi <b>said to him:</b> Man of great <b>skull,</b> i.e., man of distinction, <b>I saw your head between the pillars</b> of the study hall <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan taught this <i>halakha</i>,</b> meaning you grasped the meaning as though you actually were present in the study hall and heard the statement from Rabbi Yoḥanan himself.<br><b>It was also stated</b> that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the case of <b>the ascents and descents of Eretz Yisrael, one is not liable for</b> carrying in <b>the public domain, because they are not like the banners in the desert.</b> To be regarded as a public domain, a place must be similar to the area in which the banners of the tribes of Israel passed in the desert, i.e., it must be level and suitable for the passage of large numbers of people.<br><b>Raḥava raised a dilemma before Rava:</b> In the case of <b>a mound that rises to</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>within four</b> cubits, thereby fulfilling the conditions that create a private domain, <b>but many people traverse it, is one liable for</b> carrying in <b>the public domain or is one not liable?</b><br>The Gemara explains: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> this <b>should not be a dilemma for you. Just as there,</b> with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <b>where the use</b> of the public domain <b>is convenient, the Rabbis say</b> that <b>the public does not come and invalidate the partition; here, where its use is inconvenient</b> due to the slope, <b>all the more so</b> should the mound be considered partitioned off as a private domain, and the passage of the public should not invalidate it.<br><b>Where there should be a dilemma for you</b> is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does he maintain his position only <b>there, because the use</b> of the public domain <b>is convenient,</b> whereas <b>here, where its use is inconvenient,</b> he too would agree that <b>the public does not come and invalidate the partition? Or perhaps there is no difference?</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Raḥava: In such a case, <b>one is liable</b> for carrying in a public domain.<br>Raḥava asked him: <b>And</b> do you issue this ruling <b>even</b> in the case of a slope that is so steep that in order to climb it <b>one must ascend it by means of a rope? He said to him: Yes.</b> He asked him further: <b>And even in</b> the case of <b>the ascents of Beit Meron,</b> which are exceedingly steep? <b>He said to him: Yes.</b><br>Raḥava <b>raised an objection</b> to Rava’s opinion from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A courtyard</b> that was properly surrounded by partitions, <b>into which many people enter on this</b> side <b>and exit on that</b> other side, is treated like <b>the public domain</b> with regard to <b>ritual impurity,</b> so that in cases of doubt, the person is considered ritually pure, as uncertainty concerning ritual impurity only renders a person impure in an area defined as a private domain; however, it is still treated like <b>the private domain</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat.</b><br>He proceeds to clarify the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Who</b> is the author of this statement? <b>If you say</b> it was <b>the Rabbis,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <b>where the use</b> of the public domain <b>is convenient, the Rabbis say that the public does not come and invalidate the partition; here,</b> in the case of the courtyard, <b>where its use</b> as a path for a public domain <b>is inconvenient, all the more so</b> should they say that the passage of many people does not invalidate the partition and therefore there would be no need to discuss this case.<br><b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> This indicates that even Rabbi Yehuda differentiates between different paths in the public domain.<br>Rava replied: <b>No; actually,</b> you can explain that this <i>Tosefta</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> As to the question raised with regard to the novelty of this case according to their approach, <b>it was necessary for them</b> to teach us that such a courtyard is treated like <b>the public domain</b> with regard <b>to ritual impurity,</b> even though it is considered a private domain with respect to Shabbat.<br>Raḥava attempts to cite a proof again, this time from a mishna: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following teaching: <b>Alleyways that open in cisterns, ditches or caves</b> constitute <b>the private domain</b> with regard <b>to Shabbat and the public domain</b> with regard <b>to ritual impurity.</b><br>The Gemara first clarifies the wording of the mishna: <b>Should it enter your mind</b> to say that the correct reading is <b>in cisterns [<i>baborot</i>];</b> is it possible to speak of alleyways that open inside cisterns? <b>Rather,</b> it should be corrected as follows: Alleyways that open out <b>into cisterns [<i>laborot</i>]</b> constitute <b>the private domain</b> with regard <b>to Shabbat and the public domain</b> with regard <b>to ritual impurity.</b><br>Raḥava proceeds to clarify the matter: <b>Who</b> is the author of this mishna? <b>Now, if you say</b> it is <b>the Rabbis,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <b>where the use</b> of the public thoroughfare <b>is convenient,</b> the Rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>the public does not come and invalidate</b> the partition; <b>here,</b> in the case of an alleyway, <b>where its use</b> as a public thoroughfare <b>is inconvenient, all the more so</b> should they say that the passage of many people does not invalidate the partition, and so there was no need to discuss this case. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b><br>Rava refutes this argument: <b>No; actually,</b> you can explain that this mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> It does present a novel teaching, as <b>it was necessary for them</b> to teach us that such an alleyway has the status of <b>the public domain</b> with regard <b>to ritual impurity.</b> Although it is not a convenient place to cross, it is considered a public domain with respect to impurity, since many people are found there.<br>Once again Raḥava attempts to cite a proof from a mishna: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following teaching: <b>The paths of Beit Gilgul,</b> which are difficult to traverse, <b>and similar ones</b> have the status of <b>the private domain</b> with regard <b>to Shabbat, and</b> that of <b>the public domain</b> with regard <b>to ritual impurity.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> paths <b>are</b> like <b>the paths of Beit Gilgul? The school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> This is <b>any</b> path in which <b>a slave [<i>eved</i>] is unable to take up a <i>se’a</i> of wheat</b> by hand <b>and run before an officer [<i>sardeyot</i>],</b> despite his fear of him.<br>Raḥava proceeds to clarify the issue: <b>Who</b> is the author of this mishna? <b>Now, if you say</b> it is <b>the Rabbis,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <b>where the use</b> of the public thoroughfare <b>is convenient, the Rabbis say</b> that <b>the public does not come and invalidate the partition; here,</b> in the case of the paths of Beit Gilgul, <b>where their use</b> as a public pathway <b>is inconvenient, all the more so</b> should they say that the passage of many people does not invalidate the partitions. <b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b><br>Rava <b>said to him: Did you say the paths of Beit Gilgul? Joshua,</b> who conquered the land and divided it among the tribes, <b>was a lover of Israel. He rose up and established roads and highways for them; any place that was convenient to use he handed over to the public,</b> and <b>any place that was inconvenient to use he handed over to an individual.</b> Therefore, the roads of Eretz Yisrael, which like the paths of Beit Gilgul are not easy to use, have the status of a private domain. However, there is no general rule in other places that roads that are difficult to traverse do not have the status of a public domain.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a public cistern</b> containing collected water, <b>as well as a public well</b> containing spring water, <b>and</b> even <b>a private well, one may arrange</b> upright <b>boards around them</b> in order to allow one to carry in the enclosed area, as delineated above.<br><b>But</b> in the case of <b>a private cistern,</b> there are two deficiencies: It belongs to an individual, and it does not contain spring water. Consequently, it is impossible to permit drawing from it on Shabbat by means of boards set up in the corners; rather, <b>one must construct for it a</b> proper <b>partition ten handbreadths high;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava says: One may arrange</b> upright <b>boards only for a public well. But for the others,</b> that is, a public cistern or a private well, <b>one must set up a belt,</b> i.e., a partition consisting of ropes, <b>ten handbreadths high.</b> Such an arrangement creates a proper partition based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, namely, that solid surfaces with gaps between them smaller than three handbreadths are considered joined.<br><br></body></html>
