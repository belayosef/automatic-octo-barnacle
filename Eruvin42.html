Daf 42a<br><br><b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> If the produce was returned and is now <b>in its</b> original <b>place, it may be eaten;</b> but if it is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., if it is still beyond the Shabbat limit, <b>it may not be eaten.</b><br>The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> meant by: <b>In its place? If you say</b> that the produce was returned to <b>its place intentionally,</b> there is a difficulty, <b>as it was explicitly taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say:</b> It <b>is actually prohibited</b> to carry the produce beyond four cubits, <b>unless it was returned to its place unwittingly.</b> By inference, only if it was returned <b>unwittingly</b> is it <b>indeed</b> permitted, but if it was returned <b>intentionally,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted.<br><b>Rather,</b> does it <b>not</b> mean that the produce was returned <b>to its place unwittingly, and</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and it teaches the following:</b> With regard to <b>produce that was taken out beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> if it was taken out <b>unwittingly, it may be eaten;</b> but if it was taken out <b>intentionally, it may not be eaten.</b><br><b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case where the produce is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., it is still beyond the Shabbat limit. <b>But</b> if it was returned and is now <b>in its</b> original <b>place, even</b> if it was returned <b>intentionally, it may be eaten. And Rabbi Neḥemya came to say: Even</b> if the produce was returned and is now <b>in its</b> original <b>place,</b> a distinction applies. If it was returned <b>unwittingly, yes,</b> it is permitted; but if it was returned <b>intentionally,</b> it is <b>not.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> this is not necessarily the case, as the <i>baraita</i> can also be explained as follows: If the produce was returned <b>intentionally to its place, everyone agrees,</b> i.e., both the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Neḥemya, that <b>it is forbidden. However, here they disagree with regard to</b> produce that was <b>unwittingly</b> taken out beyond the Shabbat limit and was not returned, so that it is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that if the produce was taken out <b>unwittingly, it is permitted</b> to be eaten, even if it is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that <b>even</b> if the produce was taken out <b>unwittingly,</b> if it was returned <b>to its</b> original <b>place,</b> it <b>is</b> permitted; but if it was not returned <b>to its</b> original <b>place,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted.<br>The Gemara objects to this reading: <b>However, since the latter clause</b> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say: Actually,</b> carrying the produce beyond four cubits <b>is prohibited, unless it was returned to its place unwittingly,</b> and by inference, only if it was <b>unwittingly</b> returned is it <b>indeed</b> permitted; however, if it was returned <b>intentionally,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted. And since Rabbi Neḥemya maintains that produce that was intentionally returned to its place is forbidden, <b>by inference, the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that even if it was returned <b>intentionally, it is also permitted.</b> If so, the preceding explanation cannot be accepted, and the Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that Rav Pappa’s opinion is supported by the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>one was walking</b> in a certain place <b>and does not know</b> where <b>the Shabbat limit</b> lies, <b>he may take two thousand medium strides</b> in each direction from the spot he acquired as his place of residence, <b>and this is the Shabbat limit,</b> for a medium stride is approximately a cubit.<br><b>And Rav Naḥman</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>one established residence in a valley, and gentiles surrounded</b> the entire area <b>with a partition</b> for the purpose of residence <b>on Shabbat, he may walk</b> only <b>two thousand cubits</b> in each direction, as he cannot rely on partitions that were not present when he acquired his place of residence. However, <b>he may carry in the entire</b> partitioned area, as in any other private domain, even in the part that is beyond his two thousand cubits, but only <b>by means of throwing,</b> as he himself cannot accompany the object past two thousand cubits.<br><b>Rav Huna said: He may walk two thousand cubits;</b> however, even within this area <b>he may carry</b> objects only a distance of <b>four cubits,</b> as in a <i>karmelit</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And let him</b> be permitted to <b>carry in the entire</b> partitioned area <b>by means of throwing.</b> Although he himself is limited in where he may walk, the partitions render it a private domain, and he should be permitted to carry in the entire area.<br>The Gemara answers: The Sages prohibited this as a preventive measure, <b>lest he be drawn after his object.</b> It is prohibited for him to leave the two thousand cubit limit, but were he permitted to carry by means of throwing, he might follow his object and go out beyond his permitted limit.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Within two thousand</b> cubits, <b>at any rate, let him carry</b> the object <b>in his usual manner.</b> Since he may traverse this area, there should be no concern that he might come to be drawn after the object.<br>The Gemara answers that this is prohibited due to another aspect of the laws of <i>eiruvin</i>, namely <b>because this is similar</b> to the case of <b>a partition that is breached in its entirety,</b> leaving the space open <b>to a place into which it is prohibited</b> to carry. Since he may not carry more than two thousand cubits, and the enclosed area is larger than two thousand cubits, the area that is permitted to him is breached in its entirety, left open to an area that is prohibited to him. Consequently, carrying is prohibited in the entire area, even by means of throwing.<br>However, <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav said:</b> In that case, <b>he may walk two thousand cubits, and he may</b> also <b>carry</b> objects <b>within</b> these <b>two thousand cubits.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ḥiyya bar Rav issue his ruling? It is <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> while this dispute would appear to leave no place for a third opinion.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Read</b> Ḥiyya bar Rav’s ruling as follows: <b>He may carry</b> objects only a distance of <b>four</b> cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the opinion <b>of Rav Huna.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Read</b> it then as follows: <b>And similarly, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav said.</b><br><b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna: Do not argue with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel</b> as cited by Rav Naḥman with regard to a field surrounded by a partition on Shabbat, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:<br><br>Daf 42b<br><br>If a person <b>was measuring</b> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and his measuring ended in the middle of the city, he is permitted to carry throughout the city, provided that he does not overstep the limit by foot,</b> i.e., that he does not walk beyond his permitted limit in the middle of the city. If he cannot walk about on foot, <b>how can he carry</b> throughout the city? Is it <b>not by means of throwing?</b> This presents a difficulty for Rav Huna, who prohibits carrying by means of throwing in a place where it is prohibited to walk.<br><b>Rav Huna said: No,</b> it means that he may carry in the city <b>by means of pulling,</b> i.e., he is permitted to pull objects from the other side of the city to the side where he is permitted to walk, for in this manner there is no concern that he might be drawn after the object, since he is bringing the object to him.<br>Similarly, <b>Rav Huna said:</b> If a person <b>was measuring</b> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and his measuring ended in the middle of a courtyard, he has only half the courtyard</b> in which to walk.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: It is <b>obvious</b> that he is not permitted to walk beyond his Shabbat limit. The Gemara answers: <b>Read</b> Rav Huna’s statement as follows: <b>He has half a courtyard,</b> i.e., Rav Huna addresses a different aspect of the issue; namely, he permits carrying in half the courtyard.<br>The Gemara asks: However, <b>this too is obvious,</b> for why should it be prohibited for him to carry in a private domain where he is permitted to walk? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we should be concerned that</b> if he is permitted to carry in half the courtyard, <b>he might come to carry in the entire</b> courtyard. <b>Consequently,</b> Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that this concern is not taken into account.<br><b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Rav <b>Huna agrees with me</b> that carrying is not prohibited in a comparable case, out of concern that the person be drawn after the object he is carrying: If a person <b>was measuring</b> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and his measuring ended at the edge of the roof</b> of a house, most of which stood outside his Shabbat limit, <b>he is permitted to carry throughout the house</b> by means of throwing.<br><b>What is the reason</b> that Rav Huna agrees in this case? <b>Because</b> the edge of <b>the roof of the house</b> is regarded as if it <b>presses</b> down vertically at the end of his Shabbat limit, thus creating a partition, and so there is no concern that he might pass beyond this partition and be drawn after his object.<br><b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said:</b> The dispute between Shmuel and Rav Huna is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> recorded in the mishna: If the gentiles <b>brought him to a different city</b> beyond his Shabbat limit, <b>or if they put him in a pen or a stable,</b> the Sages disagree. <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya say: He may walk about the entire</b> stable or pen. Since they are enclosed by a partition, their entire area is considered like only four cubits. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva say: He has only four cubits</b> from where he was deposited.<br><b>Is it not</b> the case that <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who said: He may walk about the entire</b> area, <b>do not prohibit walking in a pen or a stable due to walking in a field</b> where one is limited to four cubits? Rather, they say that since the stable is surrounded by partitions, it is not similar to a field, in which a person may not leave his four cubits.<br><b>And since they did not prohibit walking</b> in a pen or a stable <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> in a field, <b>they would</b> certainly <b>not prohibit carrying</b> in a pen <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> in a field. Rather, they would permit a person to carry in a field that had been enclosed on Shabbat by gentiles, and even to throw into the part lying beyond his two thousand cubits, parallel to the opinion of Shmuel who did not decree against this.<br><b>And</b> is it not the case that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, who say</b> that <b>he has only four cubits, prohibit walking in a pen or a stable due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking in a field? And since they prohibit walking</b> in a pen or a stable <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> in a field, <b>they would also prohibit carrying</b> past the two thousand cubit limit by means of throwing <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> past there, in accordance with Rav Huna’s opinion.<br>The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>From what</b> do you infer that this is the case? <b>Perhaps Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya did not prohibit walking in a pen or a stable due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking in a field,</b> but <b>this applies</b> only <b>there, because they are two</b> distinct <b>places.</b> In other words, the pen and stable are enclosed by partitions, while the field is not, and there is no reason to prohibit walking in one place out of concern that one might come to act improperly in a different place.<br><b>However,</b> as for the prohibition of <b>carrying due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking,</b> where <b>it is</b> all <b>one place,</b> might we <b>also</b> say <b>that</b> even Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>would decree</b> against carrying <b>as a preventive measure, lest the person be drawn after his object</b> and come to walk in a place prohibited to him.<br>The comparison can also be rejected from another angle: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva too, from what</b> can it be inferred <b>that</b> they prohibit walking beyond four cubits <b>due to a decree? Perhaps</b> it is <b>because they hold</b> that <b>when we say that the entire house is considered like four cubits,</b> this <b>applies only where one acquired his place of residence within the airspace of</b> the <b>partitions</b> of the house <b>while it was still day,</b> i.e., prior to the onset of Shabbat.<br><b>However, where he did not acquire his place of residence within the airspace of</b> the <b>partitions</b> of the house <b>while it was still day,</b> the house, and all the more so the stable or pen, is <b>not</b> considered as four cubits; rather, it is measured based on the actual number of cubits it contains. Based on this explanation, this ruling indicates nothing with regard to the issue of throwing beyond the two-thousand cubit limit. Consequently, the Gemara rejects the link between the dispute of the <i>tanna’im</i> in the mishna and that of Rav Naḥman and Rav Huna.<br><b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a pen, a stable, and a boat. And Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a boat, but not with regard to a stable or a pen.</b><br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>At any rate, all agree,</b> i.e., both Rav and Shmuel, <b>that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a boat. What is the reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is different in this case than in the other cases?<br><b>Rabba said:</b> This is <b>since he acquired his place of residence within the partitions</b> of the boat <b>while it was still day,</b> in which case it is reasonable to say that the entire boat is considered as if it is only four cubits.<br><b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is <b>since the boat</b> constantly moves the person out of his four cubits, <b>lifting him from the beginning of four</b> cubits <b>and placing him at the end of four</b> cubits. Since in any case he cannot restrict himself to any particular four cubits, even if he wished to do so, it is reasonable to say that he is permitted to walk about the entire boat.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a case where <b>the walls of the boat were breached,</b> so that the person is no longer located between its partitions. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the person <b>jumped from one boat to another,</b> so that he is no longer on the boat where he had acquired his place of residence. In both of these cases, Rabba’s reason no longer applies, but Rabbi Zeira’s reason does.<br>The Gemara asks: As for <b>Rabbi Zeira, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> whose explanation is more straightforward? The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you: The sides</b> of a boat are not regarded as proper partitions,<br><br></body></html>
