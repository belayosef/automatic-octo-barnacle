Daf 89a<br><br><b>They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the residents of the two upper stories <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, <b>but if they established a</b> joint <b><i>eiruv</i>, they are</b> all <b>permitted</b> to pour water into the courtyard.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, what is the reason</b> that the residents who did not dig a pit may <b>not</b> pour water into the courtyard? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is <b>a decree, lest</b> people <b>come to take out vessels</b> filled with water <b>from</b> their <b>houses into</b> the courtyard, to pour into the pit. In the absence of an <i>eiruv</i>, this practice is prohibited.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the roofs of the city</b> are considered <b>one domain.</b> It is permitted to carry from one roof to another, even if the residents of the houses did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> between them. The Sages did not prohibit carrying between roofs, as it is rare to transfer an item from one roof to another. However, it is only permitted to transfer objects between roofs <b>provided that</b> one <b>roof is neither ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher nor ten</b> handbreadths <b>lower</b> than the adjacent roof. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Each and every one</b> of the roofs is <b>a domain in and of itself.</b> It is permitted to carry from one to the other only if the residents of both houses established an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs, courtyards, and enclosures are all one domain with regard to vessels that were inside them</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began, and one may therefore carry from one of these areas to another. However, they are <b>not</b> one domain <b>with regard to vessels that were inside the house</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began and were later taken into one of the above domains. A vessel that was inside the house when Shabbat began and subsequently carried to one of these areas may be carried from one roof, courtyard, or enclosure to another only if an <i>eiruv</i> had been established between the domains.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin were sitting, and Abaye was sitting beside them, and they sat and said: Granted, the Rabbis maintain: Just as residents are divided</b> into separate domains <b>below,</b> and they may not carry from house to house without an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>so are residents divided</b> into separate domains <b>above,</b> on the rooftops, and it is prohibited to carry from one roof to another without an <i>eiruv</i>.<br><b>However, Rabbi Meir, what does he maintain;</b> what is the rationale for his opinion? <b>If he maintains</b> that <b>just as residents are divided</b> into separate domains <b>below, so are residents divided</b> into separate domains <b>above, why,</b> in his opinion, <b>are they</b> considered <b>one domain? And if he maintains</b> that <b>they are not divided</b> into separate domains, <b>as any</b> place <b>above ten</b> handbreadths off the ground <b>is</b> considered <b>one domain, even</b> if a <b>roof</b> is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher or ten</b> handbreadths <b>lower</b> than the adjacent roof, it should <b>likewise</b> be permitted to carry from one roof to the other.<br><b>Abaye said to them:</b> Have <b>you not heard that which Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Any place that you find two domains,</b> i.e., places set apart from each other by disparity in height or by boundaries, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are</b> halakhically <b>one domain, for example, a pillar ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide</b> situated <b>in a private domain,</b> it is <b>prohibited to adjust</b> a burden on one’s <b>shoulders upon it,</b> by rabbinic <b>decree, due to</b> the concern lest he come to do the same thing on <b>a mound in the public domain.</b> The legal status of a mound ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide located in a public domain is that of a private domain. In that case, it is prohibited by Torah law to transfer an object from the public domain to the mound. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of roofs, Rabbi Meir prohibited transferring objects between roofs with a height disparity of ten handbreadths, by rabbinic <b>decree, due to</b> the concern lest one come to transfer an object from the public domain to <b>a mound in a public domain.</b><br>Abaye and Ḥanina bar Avin <b>understood</b> by inference <b>from this</b> ruling that in the opinion of Rabbi Meir, it would be prohibited to adjust one’s burden <b>even</b> on <b>a mortar and even</b> on <b>a vat</b> that were overturned in a private domain and that are large enough to constitute private domains in their own right.<br><b>Abaye said to them: The Master,</b> Rabba, <b>said as follows: Rabbi Meir spoke only</b> in the case of <b>a pillar or the</b> raised <b>base of a millstone. Since a person fixes a place for them</b> they are comparable to a mound in a public domain in that they are rarely moved. However, the Sages did not issue a decree in the case of portable objects.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty. There is the case of <b>a wall that is between two courtyards, which</b> is <b>fixed, and</b> nevertheless <b>Rav Yehuda said: When</b> you analyze the matter, <b>you will find</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Meir</b> all <b>roofs</b> form a single <b>domain in and of themselves,</b> and likewise all <b>courtyards</b> form a single <b>domain in and of themselves,</b> and all <b>enclosures</b> form a single <b>domain in and of themselves.</b> It is permitted to carry from one courtyard to another, although it is not permitted to carry from a courtyard to a roof.<br><b>What, is it not that it is permitted to move</b> objects from one courtyard to another <b>via a</b> dividing <b>wall,</b> even though it is ten handbreadths high? This poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who prohibits the transfer of an object from one place to a place ten handbreadths higher or lower.<br><b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: No,</b> that explanation is incorrect, as Rav Yehuda meant to say that according to Rabbi Meir it is permitted <b>to carry in and carry out</b> between one courtyard and another, or from one enclosure to another, <b>via</b> the <b>openings</b> between them. However, Rabbi Meir concedes that one may not transfer objects over the wall that separates the two domains, as the wall is considered a domain in and of itself.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>each and every one</b> of the roofs <b>is a domain in and of itself. It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the following issue. <b>Rav said:</b> According to the Rabbis, <b>one may move</b> objects on each roof <b>only within four cubits.</b> As, according to the Rabbis, the legal status of roofs is like that of courtyards, in that it is prohibited to carry from one roof to another, and each roof is fully open to a domain into which carrying is prohibited. Therefore, it is also prohibited to carry objects farther than four cubits on each roof. <b>And Shmuel said: It is permitted to move</b> objects throughout each <b>entire</b> roof.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>With regard to partitions that are conspicuous,</b> i.e., detached houses whose walls are distinct, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is permitted to carry throughout each roof. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>with regard to partitions that are not conspicuous,</b> i.e., attached houses, which appear as though they share a common roof although they are owned by different people.<br><b>Rav said: One may carry</b> on each roof <b>only within four cubits.</b> Rav <b>does not state</b> the principle: <b>Extend and raise the partitions</b> between the houses below, which states that the walls of the houses are considered to extend upward and create partitions between the roofs. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It is <b>permitted to carry throughout</b> each <b>entire</b> roof, <b>as he states</b> the principle: <b>Extend and raise the partitions.</b><br>The Gemara asks a question based on that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: And <b>the Rabbis say</b> that <b>each and every one</b> of the roofs<br><br>Daf 89b<br><br>is <b>a domain in and of itself.</b> This indicates that each roof constitutes a discrete domain, and one may carry throughout this entire domain. <b>Granted according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> this works out <b>well, but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b><br>The Gemara answers that the Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The ruling in the mishna is not a leniency permitting one to carry throughout the entire roof; rather, it is a stringency, ruling <b>that one may not move</b> an object <b>two cubits on this roof and two cubits on that roof.</b> The <i>tanna</i> rules that even the allowance to carry within four cubits is restricted to a single roof.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: When we were in Babylonia we</b> would <b>say</b> that the Sages of <b>the school of Rav said in the name of Rav: One may move</b> an object <b>on</b> each roof <b>only within four cubits, and those</b> Sages of <b>the school of Shmuel taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> in accordance with their opinion: <b>They have only their</b> own <b>roof.</b><br>The Gemara seeks to clarify this <i>baraita</i>. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the statement: <b>They have only their</b> own <b>roof?</b> Is it <b>not that they are permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout</b> each <b>entire</b> roof? This <i>baraita</i> poses a difficulty to Rav. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>And is</b> this <i>baraita</i> any <b>stronger</b> a proof <b>than our mishna, which we established</b> as a stringency, <b>that one may not move</b> an object <b>two cubits on this roof and two cubits on that roof? So too,</b> this <i>baraita</i> is teaching that one may not carry <b>two cubits on this roof and two cubits on that roof.</b><br><b>Rav Yosef said,</b> after an illness had caused him to forget his knowledge: <b>I have not heard this <i>halakha</i></b> of Shmuel’s with regard to roofs. His student <b>Abaye said to him: You</b> yourself <b>said it to us, and it was about this</b> that <b>you said it to us:</b> With regard to <b>a large roof that is adjacent to a small one,</b> carrying on <b>the large</b> one <b>is permitted,</b> as its partitions are distinct where it extends beyond the small one, <b>and</b> carrying on <b>the small one is prohibited,</b> as it is breached along its entire length into the other roof, onto which it is prohibited to carry.<br><b>And you said to us about it: Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where there are residents on this</b> roof <b>and residents on that</b> roof, <b>as</b> the extended, virtual partition <b>of the small</b> roof is considered <b>a trampled partition.</b> The residents trample this virtual partition as they move from one roof to the other, and the entire length of the small roof is considered breached into the large one.<br><b>However,</b> if <b>there are no residents on this</b> roof <b>and</b> none <b>on that</b> one, carrying on <b>both</b> roofs is <b>permitted.</b> Presumably, Shmuel’s reasoning is that in this case the walls of the houses below extend upward and form partitions between the roofs, in accordance with the principle: Extend and raise the partitions.<br>Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> I remember it now. <b>I said to you as follows: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that carrying is prohibited on the small roof, <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where there was an</b> actual <b>partition on</b> all sides of <b>this</b> roof <b>and an</b> actual <b>partition on</b> all sides of <b>that</b> roof, not only between the two roofs. In <b>that</b> case, carrying on <b>the large</b> roof <b>is permitted by</b> means of <b>the remnants</b> of the partition on either side of the opening, <b>and</b> carrying on the <b>small</b> roof <b>is</b> prohibited because it is <b>fully breached</b> into the larger one. <b>However, if there is no partition, neither on</b> all sides of <b>this</b> roof <b>nor on</b> all sides of <b>that</b> roof, carrying on <b>both of them is prohibited.</b><br>Abaye raised a difficulty: <b>But didn’t you speak to us</b> of <b>residents?</b> Rav Yosef replied: <b>If I spoke to you</b> of <b>residents, this</b> is what <b>I said to you: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that carrying is prohibited on the small roof, <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is an</b> actual <b>partition</b> that renders the area <b>fit for residence on</b> all sides of <b>this</b> roof, <b>and an</b> actual <b>partition</b> that renders the area fit <b>for residence on</b> all sides of <b>that</b> roof, as carrying on <b>the large</b> roof <b>is permitted by</b> means of <b>the remnants</b> of the partition on either side of the opening, <b>and</b> carrying on the <b>small</b> roof <b>is</b> prohibited because it is <b>fully breached</b> into the larger one.<br><b>However,</b> if <b>there is a partition</b> that renders the area fit <b>for a residence on</b> all sides of <b>the large</b> roof, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> partition that renders the area fit for <b>a residence on the small</b> roof, carrying <b>even</b> on <b>the small</b> roof <b>is permitted for the residents of the large</b> roof. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since</b> the residents of the small roof <b>did not erect a partition</b> around their roof, <b>they</b> thereby <b>removed themselves from here</b> and transferred the right to their domain to the residents of the large roof.<br>This is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Naḥman said:</b> If one <b>affixed a permanent ladder to his roof,</b> while the owners of the neighboring roofs did not do so, it <b>is permitted for him to</b> carry on <b>all the roofs.</b> The failure of the other owners to erect a ladder indicates that they relinquished the right to their roofs to the one who affixed the permanent ladder.<br><b>Abaye said:</b> If a person <b>built an upper story atop his house,</b> by surrounding the roof with walls, <b>and erected before its</b> entrance <b>a small partition [<i>dakka</i>] four</b> cubits high that opens to other roofs, <b>it is permitted</b> for him <b>to</b> carry on <b>all the roofs.</b> His construction of the partition is indicative of his plans to utilize the other roofs, while the failure of the other owners to do so indicates that they conceded use of their roofs to him.<br><b>Rava said: Sometimes the small partition</b> leads <b>to prohibition. What are the circumstances</b> of this case? It is a case <b>where</b> the partition <b>was erected</b> facing <b>toward the garden of his house</b> and the sides facing the other roofs were sealed. The reason is <b>that</b> through his actions <b>he said</b><br><br></body></html>
