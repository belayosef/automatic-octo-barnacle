Daf 97a<br><br>and <b>whether</b> the phylacteries are <b>new or old;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> carrying <b>new</b> phylacteries <b>but permits</b> carrying <b>old ones. Apparently,</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>a person exerts</b> himself to fashion an amulet that looks like phylacteries, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>a person does not exert</b> himself for this purpose, and therefore something that has the appearance of phylacteries must be phylacteries.<br><b><i>Shin</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>yod</i></b> is a <b>mnemonic</b> for the statements that follow. The Gemara adds: <b>And now that the father of Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak has taught</b> that <b>these are</b> deemed <b>old</b> phylacteries: <b>Any that have straps that</b> are permanently <b>tied</b> in the manner of phylacteries, and <b>new</b> phylacteries are those <b>that have straps that are not tied,</b> the conclusion is <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>a person does not exert</b> himself to fashion an amulet similar to phylacteries or string-like ritual fringes. They disagree with regard to new phylacteries that are not tied properly and cannot be donned in a manner typical of a weekday. The reason is that tying a permanent knot on Shabbat is prohibited by Torah law. Therefore, these phylacteries may not be donned, and Rabbi Zeira’s opinion is accepted.<br>The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that new phylacteries may not be brought into town because they lack a permanent knot: Why must one tie the phylacteries with a knot? <b>Let him</b> simply <b>tie a bow,</b> which is not prohibited on Shabbat, and place the phylacteries on his head and arm in that manner. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: That is to say</b> that <b>a bow is invalid for phylacteries,</b> as a proper knot is required.<br><b>Abaye said:</b> This is not the correct interpretation. Rather, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms to <b>his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said: A bow is a full-fledged knot,</b> and it is prohibited to tie it on Shabbat by Torah law.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>The reason</b> that it is prohibited to tie a bow is <b>that a bow is a full-fledged knot.</b> If <b>that were not so,</b> one could <b>tie</b> the phylacteries <b>with a bow. But didn’t Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, say in the name of Rav:</b> The form of the permanent <b>knot of phylacteries is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai; and Rav Naḥman said: And their decorative</b> side, the side of the knot where the shape of the letter appears, must face <b>outward.</b> Apparently, a bow does not suffice for phylacteries, as an actual knot is required.<br>The Gemara rejects this contention: It is referring to a case <b>where one tied a bow similar</b> in form <b>to a</b> permanent <b>knot,</b> without actually tying a permanent knot.<br><b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who purchases</b> a large quantity of <b>phylacteries from one who is not an expert,</b> i.e., a person who has not proven to be a reliable manufacturer of phylacteries, the purchaser <b>examines two</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm and one of the head, or two of the head and one of the arm,</b> to see if they are valid and the individual reliable. If the three phylacteries are found to be valid upon examination, the seller is considered an expert and the rest of the phylacteries are presumed valid as well.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Whichever way you look at it,</b> this ruling is problematic: <b>If</b> the buyer <b>purchased</b> all of the phylacteries <b>from one person,</b> who acquired them from somebody else, <b>let him examine three</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm or three of the head,</b> in accordance with the principle that presumptive status is established after three instances.<br><b>If he purchased</b> the phylacteries <b>from two</b> or <b>three people, each and every one</b> of the phylacteries <b>should require examination.</b> The presumptive status of one pair of phylacteries does not apply to the others, as they might have been produced by a different person. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this refers to a case where the buyer <b>bought</b> the phylacteries <b>from one person, and we require</b> that the seller prove himself <b>to be an expert with regard to</b> both the phylactery <b>of the arm and</b> the phylactery <b>of the head.</b><br>The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> that <b>with</b> regard to <b>phylacteries one examines three of the arm and</b> three <b>of the head? What, is it not</b> that he examines <b>either three</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm or three of the head?</b> The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> it means that he examines <b>three</b> phylacteries in total, <b>among them</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm and among them</b> phylacteries <b>of the head,</b> as stated by Rav Ḥisda in the name of Rav.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Kahana teach</b> that <b>with</b> regard to <b>phylacteries one examines two of the arm and</b> two <b>of the head?</b> This statement certainly contradicts Rav’s opinion. The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said: Presumptive status is</b> established <b>by two times.</b> Although most Sages maintain that it takes three instances to establish a presumptive status, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rules that two cases suffice. Consequently, in the case of phylacteries, it is sufficient to examine two.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>And</b> he must <b>likewise</b> examine <b>the second bundle</b> of phylacteries, <b>and likewise the third bundle. And if it is</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, <b>is he of</b> the opinion that <b>a third</b> examination is necessary? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not require a third examination to establish a presumptive status, as he maintains that the examination of two bundles suffices.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes with regard to bundles, as one buys</b> them <b>from two</b> or <b>three</b> different <b>people.</b> It can be assumed that the various bundles of phylacteries were not all manufactured by the same person. Consequently, the validity of one bundle does not establish a presumption with regard to another. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, even</b> the <b>fourth</b> bundle must be examined <b>as well, and even</b> the <b>fifth as well.</b> If the bundles were bought from different manufacturers, every one of them requires examination, not only the third.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this is how one must proceed. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>teaches three</b> bundles rather than four or five is <b>to exclude</b> the third bundle <b>from its presumptive status.</b> By stating that the third bundle must be examined, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi indicates that in this case two examinations do not establish a presumption; rather, all of the bundles must be checked. <b>And actually, even</b> the <b>fourth and fifth</b> bundles require examination <b>as well.</b><br>It was stated in the mishna that if <b>one finds</b> phylacteries <b>tied in bundles or in wrapped piles,</b> he sits there and waits with them until dark and then brings them in. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>bundles</b> in this context, <b>and what is</b> meant by <b>wrapped piles? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The same types of objects <b>are</b> called <b>bundles, and they are</b> also called <b>wrapped piles,</b> i.e., both contain more than one pair of phylacteries. <b>Bundles</b> consist of many pairs of phylacteries arranged <b>in pairs [<i>zuvei</i>]</b> of a head phylactery with an arm phylactery, whereas <b>wrapped piles</b> indicates <b>that many</b> phylacteries <b>are wrapped together</b> in no particular arrangement.<br>We learned in the mishna that one sits there and <b>waits with them until dark and</b> then <b>brings them</b> in. The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> must he do that? <b>Let him bring them in pair</b> by <b>pair. Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said:</b> This matter <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by</b> my <b>father</b> as follows: <b>Any</b> instance where there are few enough phylacteries <b>that were he to bring them in pair</b> by <b>pair he would finish before sunset, he brings them</b> in <b>pair</b> by <b>pair. But if not,</b> i.e., if there are so many pairs of phylacteries that were he to bring them in one pair at a time he would not bring them all in before sunset, <b>he waits</b> there <b>with</b> all of <b>them until dark and</b> then <b>brings them</b> in.<br>It was stated in the mishna that <b>in</b> a time of <b>danger one covers</b> the phylacteries <b>and proceeds on his</b> way. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>And in</b> a time of <b>danger he carries them less than four cubits</b> at a time? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> mishna, which states that the finder covers the phylacteries, it is referring <b>to the danger</b> posed <b>by gentiles,</b> where the gentile authorities decreed against donning phylacteries and the finder is afraid to be seen carrying them. However, in <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one may carry them less than four cubits at a time, it is dealing <b>with the danger</b> posed <b>by bandits [<i>listim</i>].</b> In that case he is afraid to remain there until dark, but he is not worried about taking the phylacteries with him. Consequently, he may carry them less than four cubits at a time.<br><br>Daf 97b<br><br><b>Abaye said to him: In what</b> manner <b>did you establish our mishna</b> as dealing <b>with the danger</b> posed <b>by gentiles? Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna as follows: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>one gives them to another and the other</b> passes them <b>to another.</b> In that case, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>the matter be conspicuous,</b> and they should fear the decree issued by the gentiles.<br>The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: In what case is this statement</b> that the finder covers the phylacteries <b>said?</b> It is where the concern is <b>danger</b> posed by <b>gentiles. However,</b> where the concern is <b>danger</b> posed by <b>bandits, one carries them less than four cubits at a time.</b> In that case Rabbi Shimon disagrees, maintaining that it is preferable that many people carry the phylacteries.<br>It is stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One gives them to another</b> and the other passes them to another. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do <b>they disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that having one person carrying the phylacteries <b>less than four cubits</b> at a time <b>is preferable, as if you say</b> that the finder <b>gives them to another, and</b> the <b>other</b> passes them <b>to another, Shabbat</b> desecration <b>will be noticeable,</b> thereby demeaning Shabbat’s character as a sacred day of rest.<br><b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that the solution that <b>one gives</b> the phylacteries <b>to another is preferable, as if you say</b> that the finder <b>carries them less than four cubits</b> at a time, <b>sometimes it is not in his thoughts and</b> will unwittingly <b>come to carry</b> the phylacteries <b>four cubits in the public domain.</b> That is unlikely if there are numerous people together.<br>It was stated in the mishna: <b>And the same</b> is true with regard to <b>one’s son.</b> The Gemara is surprised: <b>What is his son doing there</b> in the field necessitating his retrieval in this way? <b>The school of Menashe taught:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where his mother gave birth to him in a field,</b> and he must be brought to town.<br><b>And what</b> may be inferred from the mishna’s ruling that the baby is passed from one person to the next, <b>even</b> if it requires <b>a hundred</b> people? This teaches <b>that although it is difficult for</b> the child to be passed from <b>hand</b> to hand, <b>even so, this</b> method of transporting him <b>is preferable</b> to his being carried by one person less than four cubits at a time.<br>It was stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person gives a barrel to another,</b> and the other may pass it to another, and in that way they may take it even beyond the Shabbat limit. The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rabbi Yehuda not of the opinion</b> of that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna: The distance that <b>an animal and vessels</b> may be taken <b>is like</b> the distance that <b>the feet of the owners</b> may go with regard to Shabbat limits?<br><b>Reish Lakish said in the name of Levi the Elder: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case where <b>one pours</b> the water <b>from one barrel to</b> another <b>barrel</b> so that only the water, rather than the barrel itself, is taken beyond the limit. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> follows <b>his</b> usual <b>reasoning, as he said: Water has no substance,</b> i.e., it is not significant enough for its transfer beyond the Shabbat limit to be prohibited.<br><b>As we learned</b> in a mishna that discusses a dispute on this issue: If one person adds flour for dough while another adds the water, the Rabbis say that the dough may only be taken as far as both owners are permitted to go, whereas <b>Rabbi Yehuda exempts water</b> from any limit <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>it has no substance.</b><br><b>And what,</b> then, is the meaning of the Rabbis’ statement in the mishna: <b>This</b> may <b>not go</b> farther than the feet of the owners may go, which apparently refers to the barrel? It means: <b>That which is in this</b> barrel may <b>not go farther than the feet of the owners</b> may go.<br>The Gemara rejects this explanation. <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> express <b>his</b> opinion that water has no substance in a case <b>where it is absorbed in dough;</b> but in a case <b>where it is in its pure, unadulterated</b> state <b>did you hear him</b> say so? <b>Now,</b> if with regard to water <b>in a pot</b> of cooked food <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that it <b>is not nullified,</b> would it be <b>nullified when it is in its pure, unadulterated</b> state? That is clearly not the case, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Water and salt are nullified in dough,</b> as they are absorbed into it and are not independently discernible. However, <b>they are not nullified in a pot</b> of cooked food, <b>because</b> the water and salt are discernible in <b>its gravy.</b><br><b>Rather, Rava</b> rejected this explanation and <b>said: Here, we are dealing with a barrel</b> that belonged to a particular individual who <b>acquired residence</b> at the start of Shabbat in a specific location, <b>and water that did not</b> remain in one place, i.e., spring or river water, and that does not belong to any individual who <b>acquired residence.</b> In that case, <b>the barrel is nullified relative to the water,</b> since the barrel is designated to hold the water.<br><b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who carries out a living person on a bed</b> from one domain to another on Shabbat <b>is exempt even for</b> carrying out <b>the bed, due to</b> the fact <b>that the bed is secondary to</b> the person. He is exempt for carrying out the living person because a living being carries itself, i.e., the person being carried lightens the load and thereby assists those bearing him.<br>Similarly, <b>one who carries out</b> an amount of <b>food, less than the measure</b> that determines liability for carrying out food on Shabbat, <b>in a vessel is exempt, even for</b> carrying out <b>the vessel, due to</b> the fact <b>that the vessel is secondary to</b> the food inside it. By the same reasoning, the barrel should be nullified relative to the water it contains.<br><b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If members of <b>a caravan</b> camped in a field wish to drink, one <b>person gives a barrel to another, and the other</b> passes it <b>to another.</b> By inference: <b>In a caravan, yes,</b> it is permitted to do so due to exigent circumstances; however, in a case <b>that</b> is <b>not a caravan, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>Rather, Rav Yosef said: When we learned</b> the case <b>in the mishna as well, we learned</b> it with regard <b>to a caravan.</b> The Sages were lenient in the case of a caravan due to the lack of water.<br><b>Abaye said</b> that this explanation is unnecessary: <b>In a caravan, even</b> if <b>the barrel acquired residence and the water acquired residence,</b> it is permitted to move them. If one is <b>not in a caravan,</b> if <b>the barrel acquired residence and the water did not acquire residence,</b> it is prohibited to move them.<br><b>Rav Ashi said: Here, we are dealing with an ownerless barrel and ownerless water,</b> neither of which acquired residence as they do not belong to anyone. <b>And who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> about whom it says in the mishna that <b>they said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that it may not go farther than the feet of its owners may go? <b>It is Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who, consistent with his approach, <b>said</b> that <b>ownerless objects acquire residence</b> where they were located when Shabbat began, and it is prohibited to move them beyond their limit. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the statement: <b>This</b> may <b>not go farther than the feet of its owners</b> may go, as it has no owner? It means that the barrel and water may <b>not go farther than vessels that have owners,</b> i.e., they may not be moved beyond their limit.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who <b>was reading</b> a sacred <b>book</b> in scroll form on Shabbat <b>on</b> an elevated, wide <b>threshold, and the book rolled from his hand</b> into the public domain, <b>he</b> may <b>roll it</b> back <b>to himself,</b> since one of its ends remains in his hand.<br>If <b>he was reading on top the roof,</b> which is a full-fledged private domain, <b>and the book rolled from his hand, as long as</b> the edge of the book <b>did not reach</b> within <b>ten handbreadths</b> above the public domain, the book is still in its own domain, and he may <b>roll it</b> back <b>to himself.</b> However, <b>once the book has reached</b> within <b>ten handbreadths</b> above the public domain, it is prohibited to roll the book back to oneself. In that case, <b>he</b> may only <b>turn it</b> over <b>onto the</b> side with <b>writing,</b> so that the writing of the book will be facedown and not exposed and degraded.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the scroll <b>is removed only a needle breadth from the ground, he rolls it</b> back <b>to himself. Rabbi Shimon says: Even if</b> the scroll is <b>on the ground itself, he rolls it</b> back <b>to himself, as you have nothing</b> that was instituted <b>as a rabbinic decree</b> to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <b>rest</b> that <b>stands</b> as an impediment <b>before</b> the rescue of <b>sacred writings.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the first clause of the mishna: <b>What are the circumstances of this threshold? If you say</b> it is referring to <b>a threshold</b> that is <b>a private domain, and</b> there is <b>a public domain before it, and</b> the mishna teaches that <b>we do not issue a decree lest</b> the entire scroll <b>fall</b> from one’s hand <b>and he come to bring it</b> from a public to a private domain,<br><br></body></html>
