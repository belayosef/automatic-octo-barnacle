Daf 17a<br><br>The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <b>the first clause</b> of Rav Naḥman’s ruling <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and the latter clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, because his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds in accordance with his opinion</b> with regard to areas enclosed for the sake of an individual. This being the case, their opinion on this matter is that of the many.<br><b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> At times, for <b>three</b> people it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry even <b>in</b> an area of <b>five</b> <i>beit se’a</i>; at times, it is <b>permitted</b> for them to carry even <b>in</b> an area of <b>seven</b> <i>beit se’a</i>. These statements appear irreconcilable, and his colleagues <b>said to him: Did Rav</b> actually <b>say that? He said to them:</b> I swear by <b>the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings, that Rav said so.</b><br><b>Rav Ashi said: What is the difficulty</b> here? <b>Perhaps this is what he is saying:</b> If <b>they needed six</b> <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>and they enclosed seven, they are permitted</b> to carry <b>even in</b> all <b>seven,</b> as one empty <i>beit se’a</i> does not render it prohibited for one to carry in the rest of the area. If, however, <b>they needed only five</b> <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>and they enclosed seven,</b> carrying <b>even in five is prohibited,</b> as there is an unoccupied space of two <i>beit se’a</i>.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching,</b> that the partition renders the area fit for one to carry within it <b>provided that there will not be an unoccupied space of two <i>beit se’a</i>, what, is it not</b> in fact referring to <b>space unoccupied by people?</b> In other words, isn’t the <i>baraita</i> teaching that the enclosed area may not be two <i>beit se’a</i> larger than a measure of two <i>beit se’a</i> per person? Accordingly, if three people enclosed an area of seven <i>beit se’a</i>, it should always be permitted for them to carry there, as they are entitled to six <i>beit se’a</i> and only one <i>beit se’a</i> is unoccupied. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it means <b>unoccupied by utensils.</b> Although they would be entitled to six <i>beit se’a</i> if needed, since they need only five in practice and a space of two <i>beit se’a</i> remains unoccupied, the effectiveness of the partitions is negated and carrying therein is prohibited.<br><b>It is stated:</b> If there were <b>three</b> people in a caravan <b>and one of them died</b> on Shabbat, or if there were <b>two</b> people, <b>and</b> others <b>were added to them</b> on Shabbat, <b>Rav Huna and Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> disagree with regard to the area in which they are permitted to carry on Shabbat. <b>One said: Shabbat determines</b> the status of the area. The <i>halakha</i> is determined in accordance with the prevailing situation at the onset of Shabbat. <b>And one said</b> that <b>the residents,</b> i.e., the actual number of people present at any given moment, <b>determine</b> the status.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude that it is Rav Huna who said that Shabbat determines</b> the status, as <b>Rabba said: I raised a dilemma before Rav Huna, and I raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda</b> with regard to the following case: If one <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> to join one courtyard to another <b>via</b> a certain <b>opening and that opening was sealed</b> on Shabbat, or if one established an <i>eiruv</i> <b>via</b> a certain <b>window and that window was sealed</b> on Shabbat, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can one continue to rely on this <i>eiruv</i> and carry from one courtyard to the other via other entrances? <b>And he said to me: Since</b> it <b>was permitted</b> to carry from courtyard to courtyard at the onset of <b>Shabbat, it was permitted</b> and remains so until Shabbat’s conclusion. The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude</b> that it is Rav Huna who maintains the determining factor is Shabbat, not the residents.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that Rav Huna and Rabbi Yitzḥak are disagreeing in the</b> earlier <b>dispute of</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned</b> in a mishna: If during Shabbat <b>a courtyard was breached from two of its sides, or</b> if <b>a house was breached from two of its sides, or</b> if <b>an alleyway’s</b> cross <b>beams or side posts were removed,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to carry within them <b>on that Shabbat, but</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to do so <b>in the future;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yosei says: If</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to carry there <b>on that Shabbat,</b> it is also <b>permitted</b> to do so <b>in the future. However, if</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry there <b>in the future,</b> it is also <b>prohibited</b> to do so <b>on that Shabbat.</b> Since it is prohibited to carry there in the future, it is also prohibited to carry there on that Shabbat. This opinion disputes the principle that since it is permitted at the onset of Shabbat it remains permitted.<br><b>Let us say</b> that it is <b>Rav Huna who stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and he held that the situation at the onset of Shabbat determines the halakhic status. <b>And</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak who stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b><br>The Gemara rejects this explanation. <b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> It is <b>I who stated</b> my opinion <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yosei stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> in a case <b>where there are no</b> longer <b>partitions</b> intact; however, <b>here there are partitions</b> intact. Since the status of the area is dependent upon the existence of partitions, he would also agree that carrying is permitted in this case.<br><b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> could have <b>said</b> to you: It is <b>I who stated</b> my opinion <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> in a case <b>where there are residents.</b> However, <b>here, there are no</b> remaining <b>residents</b> that are alive, so he too would prohibit carrying.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>However, the Rabbis say: One of the two elements,</b> either vertical or horizontal, is sufficient. The Gemara asks: <b>This is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna. What did the Rabbis add?<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical halakhic difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>an individual</b> in <b>a settlement.</b> The first <i>tanna</i> does not allow one to rely on a partition of this type <i>ab initio</i>, whereas the Rabbis permit doing so in all cases.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Sages <b>exempted</b> a soldier <b>in</b> a military <b>camp</b> in <b>four matters: One may bring wood</b> for kindling <b>from any place</b> with no concern that he is stealing wood from its owners; <b>and one is exempt from</b> ritual <b>washing</b> of the <b>hands</b> before eating; <b>and</b> one is exempt <b>from</b> the separation of tithes from <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>],</b> i.e., produce purchased from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, one who is not diligent in separating tithes; <b>and</b> one is exempt <b>from establishing an <i>eiruv</i>.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to a military <b>camp that goes out to</b> wage <b>an optional war, it is permitted</b> for the soldiers <b>to steal dry wood. Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima says: They may also encamp in any location,</b> even if they damage the field in which they are encamped. <b>And in the place where they were killed, there they are buried</b> and the owner of the site cannot object, as moving the corpse for burial elsewhere dishonors the dead.<br>The Gemara analyzes this <i>Tosefta</i>. What is the novelty in the following statement: <b>They are permitted to steal dry wood? This was an ordinance</b> enacted <b>by Joshua,</b> as <b>the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is a tradition that <b>Joshua stipulated ten conditions</b> with the Jewish people as they entered Eretz Yisrael, among them <b>that</b> one <b>may graze</b> his animals <b>in woods</b> belonging to others without objection, and one may <b>gather wood</b> for his own use <b>from their fields.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Joshua’s ordinance permitted gathering various types of <b>shrubs [<i>hizmei</i>] and thorns [<i>higei</i>],</b> with regard to which people are not particular; <b>here,</b> the ordinance in the mishna pertaining to a military camp is referring to <b>other</b> types of <b>wood.</b><br><b>Alternatively: There,</b> Joshua’s ordinance referred <b>to</b> gathering thorns still <b>attached</b> to the ground, as removing those thorns benefits the field’s owner. <b>Here,</b> however, the mishna is referring <b>to</b> gathering thorns that are already <b>detached.</b><br><b>Alternatively: There,</b> Joshua’s ordinance referred <b>to</b> gathering <b>moist</b> thorns. Owners are not particular about them because they are not immediately suitable for kindling. <b>Here,</b> the mishna is referring even <b>to dry</b> thorns.<br>It was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima says: They may also encamp in any place, and in the place where they were killed, there they are buried.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: This is <b>obvious,</b> as a body of a dead soldier <b>is</b> considered to be <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>],</b> and the principle is that <b>a <i>met mitzva</i> acquires its place.</b> In other words, the body must be interred where it is found, and the owner of the field cannot prevent burial.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this ostensibly obvious statement is indeed <b>necessary</b> to teach that this principle applies in the case of a military camp, <b>even though</b><br><br>Daf 17b<br><br><b>there are</b> people available <b>to bury it. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is</b> the corpse that is considered <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>?Any</b> corpse <b>that has no one</b> available <b>to bury it.</b> If, however, the deceased has friends or relatives to tend to his burial, his corpse is not considered a <i>met mitzva</i>. Likewise, if the body is in a place where if <b>one calls out, others</b> can <b>answer him, this is not a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b> The <i>Tosefta</i> teaches a novel ruling applicable to the case of a military camp: A solider is buried where he was killed, even if the conditions for <i>met mitzva</i> are not met there.<br>With regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself, the Gemara asks: <b>And does a <i>met mitzva</i></b> actually <b>acquire its place? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who finds a corpse laid out on a main street evacuates it</b> for burial either <b>to the right of the street or to the left of the street,</b> but it may not be buried under the main street itself?<br>If one can move the corpse either to <b>an uncultivated field or</b> to <b>a plowed field, he evacuates it to the uncultivated field.</b> If the choice is between <b>a plowed field and a sown field, he evacuates it to the plowed field.</b> If <b>both</b> fields <b>are plowed,</b> or if <b>both are sown,</b> or if <b>both are uncultivated, he evacuates it to any side that he wishes</b> to move it. Apparently, a <i>met mitzva</i> is not necessarily buried where it is found. It may be moved elsewhere.<br><b>Rav Beivai said: Here we are dealing with a corpse laid out across on the side</b> of a public path, and it stretches across the path and reaches the other side. Were the corpse buried there, it would prohibit passage by priests. <b>Since permission was</b> already <b>granted to evacuate it from the side</b> of a public path, <b>one may evacuate it to any side he wishes.</b> If, however, the corpse was in a field, moving it would be prohibited.<br>We learned in the mishna that in a military camp <b>one is exempt from</b> ritual <b>washing</b> of the <b>hands. Abaye said: They taught</b> this exemption <b>only</b> with regard to <b>first waters,</b> i.e., hand-washing before eating. <b>However, final waters,</b> i.e., hand-washing after eating and before reciting Grace after Meals, <b>is an obligation</b> even in a military camp.<br><b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say that the final waters are an obligation?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there is the presence of Sodomite salt, which blinds the eyes</b> even in a small amount. Since Sodomite salt could remain on one’s hands, one must wash them after eating. This obligation is binding even in a camp because soldiers are also obligated to maintain their health.<br><b>Abaye said: And</b> this type of dangerous salt <b>is present</b> in the proportion of a single <b>grain [<i>korta</i>] in an</b> entire <b><i>kor</i></b> of innocuous salt. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>one measured salt</b> and came into contact with Sodomite salt not during mealtime, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is there an obligation to wash his hands afterward? <b>He said to him: It was unnecessary</b> to say <b>this,</b> as he is certainly obligated to do so.<br>The mishna continues: <b>And</b> in a military camp, one is exempt <b>from</b> the separation of tithes from <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>]. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may feed the poor <i>demai</i>, and</b> one may also feed <b>quartered soldiers [<i>akhsanya</i>] <i>demai</i>. Rav Huna said:</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>one may neither feed the poor <i>demai</i>, nor</b> may one feed <b>quartered soldiers <i>demai</i>. And Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>one may feed the poor <i>demai</i>, and</b> one may also feed <b>quartered soldiers <i>demai</i>.</b><br>We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> in a military camp, one is exempt <b>from establishing an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: They taught</b> that this exemption applies <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the joining of</b> houses in <b>courtyards. However,</b> even those in a military encampment <b>are obligated</b> to establish an <i>eiruv</i> if they desire to effect <b>a joining of Shabbat boundaries,</b> whereby one extends the Shabbat limits beyond which one may not walk on Shabbat.<br><b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One is flogged by Torah law for</b> going beyond the Shabbat limit if there is no <b>joining of Shabbat boundaries.</b> The Torah states: “No man shall go out [<i>al yetze</i>] of his place on the seventh day” (Exodus 16:29). Since this is a Torah prohibition, leniency is possible only in life-threatening circumstances.<br><b>Rabbi Yonatan strongly objects: Is one flogged for</b> violating <b>a prohibition that is</b> expressed in the Torah with the negative <b><i>al</i>,</b> rather than the negative <i>lo</i>? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects</b> to the question: <b>If</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> with regard to <b>that which is written: “Turn you not [<i>al</i>] unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits”</b> (Leviticus 19:31), is the <i>halakha</i> there <b>too that one is not flogged?</b><br>Rather, <b>this is</b> the <b>difficulty for Rabbi Yonatan:</b> The prohibition against overstepping the Shabbat limits is <b>a prohibition that was given</b> primarily <b>as a warning of court-imposed capital punishment,</b> i.e., a prohibition which, under certain conditions, is punishable by the death and not merely by lashes, as is the case with most prohibitions. In fact, the prohibition against carrying objects out to the public domain is derived from that same verse, and one who violates that prohibition is liable for execution by the court. <b>And</b> this principle applies: <b>Any prohibition that was given</b> primarily <b>as a warning of court-imposed capital punishment one is not flogged,</b> even if the death penalty does not apply in that particular case.<br><b>Rav Ashi said: Is it written</b> in the Torah: <b>No</b> man <b>shall carry out [<i>yotzi</i>],</b> indicating a prohibition against carrying objects from one domain to another on Shabbat? <b>“No</b> man <b>shall go out [<i>yetze</i>]” is written.</b> Indeed, according to its plain meaning, the verse deals exclusively with the prohibition of going beyond the Shabbat limits and not with the prohibition of carrying out. Everyone agrees that there is no death penalty administered by the court in overstepping the Shabbat limit.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may arrange</b> upright <b>boards [<i>passin</i>] around a well</b> in the public domain in order to permit drawing water from the well on Shabbat. A well is usually at least four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths deep. Therefore, it is considered a private domain, and it is prohibited to draw water from it on Shabbat, as that would constitute a violation of the prohibition to carry from a private domain into a public one. The Sages therefore instituted that a virtual partition may be built in the area surrounding the well, so that the enclosed area could be considered a private domain, thus permitting use of the well and carrying of the water within the partitioned area.<br>In this specific instance, the Sages demonstrated special leniency and did not require a proper partition to enclose the entire area. For this purpose, it suffices if there are <b>four double posts [<i>deyomadin</i>] that look like eight</b> single posts, i.e., four corner pieces, each comprised of two posts joined together at right angles; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> There must be <b>eight</b> posts that <b>look like twelve.</b> How so? There must be <b>four double posts,</b> one in each corner, with <b>four plain</b> posts, one between each pair of double posts.<br><b>The height</b> of the double posts must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, their width</b> must be <b>six</b> handbreadths, <b>and their thickness</b> may be even <b>a minimal amount. And between them,</b> i.e., between the posts, there may be a gap <b>the size of two teams [<i>revakot</i>] of three oxen each;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> There may be a slightly larger gap, the size of two teams <b>of four</b> oxen each, and this gap is measured with the cows being <b>tied</b> together <b>and not untied,</b> and with the minimal space necessary for <b>one</b> team to be <b>entering</b> while the other <b>one is leaving.</b><br><b>It is permitted to bring</b> the posts <b>closer to the well, provided that</b> the enclosed area is large enough for <b>a cow to</b> stand with <b>its head and the majority of its</b> body <b>inside</b> the partitioned space while <b>it drinks.</b><br><b>It is permitted</b><br><br></body></html>
