Daf 50a<br><br><b>Rabba said: What is the reason for Rav’s</b> statement that one who declares his intention to establish residence beneath a tree has said nothing at all? It is <b>because the place</b> he designated <b>is not</b> precisely <b>defined.</b> Since he did not establish his residence in one particular location, he did not establish it at all.<br><b>And some say</b> an alternative version of Rabba’s statement. <b>Rabba said: What is the reason</b> for the statement of <b>Rav?</b> It is <b>Because he maintains: Anything that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially,</b> due to halakhic or practical considerations, <b>even simultaneously, cannot</b> be accomplished, as one negates the other. In this case, since one cannot establish residence in an area of four cubits on one side of a tree and proceed to establish residence in an area of four cubits on the other side of the tree, neither can he simultaneously establish residence beneath a tree greater than four cubits.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between these</b> two versions of Rabba’s statement? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a case <b>where he said: Let</b> residence be <b>acquired for me</b> in <b>four cubits of the eight</b> or more cubits beneath that tree.<br>According to <b>the one who said</b> that it is <b>because the place</b> he designated <b>is not</b> precisely <b>defined,</b> here too, <b>the place</b> he designated <b>is not</b> precisely <b>defined,</b> as he failed to specify the precise location of the four cubits in which to establish his residence.<br><b>And</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> it is <b>because anything that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially even simultaneously</b> it <b>cannot</b> be accomplished, <b>this is</b> considered <b>as</b> if he established his residence in <b>four cubits, as here he stated</b> that he is designated only <b>four cubits</b> as his place of residence.<br>The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the matter</b> of Rabba’s statement <b>itself. Rabba said: Anything that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially even simultaneously</b> it <b>cannot</b> be accomplished. <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> based on the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who increases tithes,</b> i.e., he tithes two-tenths instead of one-tenth, the remainder of <b>his produce is rendered</b> fit for consumption, as he properly tithed it; <b>however, his tithes are ruined,</b> as the additional tenth is neither a tithe nor is it tithed produce. It is not a tithe because tithe status applies only to one tenth, and neither is it tithed produce as it was not tithed. Since it is unclear which of the two-tenths is the actual tithe and which is not, this produce may neither be treated as a tithe nor as tithed produce.<br>According to Rabba’s opinion, the question arises: <b>Why</b> should the produce be rendered fit for consumption? <b>Let us say</b> and apply his principle: <b>Anything that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially; even simultaneously</b> it <b>cannot</b> be accomplished. Since one may not designate two tenths sequentially, one tenth followed by a second tenth, likewise, he should be precluded from simultaneously designating two tenths of his produce as a tithe. Accordingly, it should be considered as though he had not designated any tithe at all, and therefore his produce should not be regarded as tithed.<br>Gemara answers: The case of <b>a tithe is different, as</b> tithe status <b>takes effect partially,</b> i.e., on less than a unit of produce. <b>As if one said: Let half of each</b> grain of <b>wheat be designated</b> as tithed, <b>it is designated.</b> Just as one can designate an entire grain of wheat as a tithe, he can likewise designate half a grain. In this case too, when one tithes two tenths of the produce, the ruling is not that one tenth is actual tithe and the other tenth is untithed produce mixed with the tithe. Instead, half of each grain of the set-aside portion is designated as a tithe, while the other half of each grain is not. Accordingly, the remainder of the produce is tithed, as one tenth of the total has been designated as first tithe. However, the portion designated as the tithe is ruined, because it is impossible to identify which part of each grain is designated.<br>Another objection was raised against Rabba’s opinion: Yet there is the case of the <b>animal tithe, which does take effect partially,</b> as one cannot consecrate half an animal for his tithe. Three times a year, the owner of a herd of kosher animals would gather all the animals born during the preceding period into an enclosure and let them out one by one. Every tenth animal would be marked with red paint to indicate that it was sacred. Only an entire animal could be consecrated as animal tithe, not a part of an animal.<br><b>And Rabba said:</b> If <b>two</b> animals <b>emerged</b> from the enclosure together <b>as the tenth, and he designated them</b> both as the <b>tenth, the tenth and eleventh</b> animals <b>are intermingled with each other.</b> One is sacred with the sanctity of the animal tithe, while the other remains a peace-offering, but there is no way to determine which is which. The question arises: If the principle that anything which cannot be accomplished sequentially; even simultaneously it cannot be accomplished applies, neither animal is consecrated, as one cannot designate both the tenth and the eleventh animals as the animal tithe, one after the other.<br>The Gemara answers: The <b>animal tithe is different, as</b> two animals can indeed be designated as animal tithe <b>one after the other in</b> the case of <b>an error.</b> Although one cannot designate the tenth and eleventh animals as the animal tithe <i>ab initio</i>, if he did so in error they are both consecrated.<br><b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If <b>one</b> erred and <b>designated the ninth</b> animal <b>as the tenth,</b> and erred again and designated <b>the tenth as the ninth and the eleventh as the tenth,</b> all <b>three</b> animals <b>are consecrated.</b> The first is consecrated because it was designated as the tenth, the second because it actually is the tenth, while the third is also consecrated because it was designated as the tenth. Apparently, more than one animal can be consecrated as the animal tithe, if designated in error. Here too, a modicum of sanctity applies to the two animals that emerged together and were together designated as the tenth.<br>The Gemara raises another objection to Rabba’s principle. <b>But there is</b> the case of the forty loaves that accompany a <b>thanks-offering, which are not</b> consecrated if they were designated <b>in error, and</b> likewise <b>are not</b> consecrated if two sets of loaves were designated for the same offering <b>one after the other. And</b> yet <b>it is stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a thanks-offering that was slaughtered</b> accompanied <b>by eighty loaves,</b> twice the required amount. <b>Ḥizkiya said: Forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated,</b> even though their identity cannot be determined; <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Not</b> even <b>forty of</b> the <b>eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated.</b> It would appear that these <i>amora’im</i> disagree whether or not sanctity that cannot take effect in sequence can take effect simultaneously.<br>The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> this dispute that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Everyone,</b> both Ḥizkiya and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>concedes</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the donor <b>said: Let forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>be consecrated, that</b> the forty <b>are consecrated;</b> and in a case where he said: <b>Let forty</b> loaves <b>only be consecrated if</b> all <b>eighty are consecrated, everyone agrees that they are not consecrated.</b> This is in accordance with Rabba’s opinion.<br><b>When</b> Ḥizkiya and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree</b> is with regard a case where the donor designated eighty loaves <b>without stipulation</b> how many he wants consecrated. <b>One Sage,</b> Ḥizkiya, <b>maintains:</b> Although he designated eighty loaves, he seeks to consecrate only forty, and when he sets aside eighty loaves, <b>he</b> merely <b>intends to ensure</b> that he will have forty, <b>and he</b> therefore <b>brought</b> the extra loaves <b>on condition</b> that if the first forty loaves are lost or become ritually impure, the second forty will be consecrated in their place. Consequently, the first forty loaves are consecrated.<br><br>Daf 50b<br><br><b>And the other Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>maintains:</b> He <b>intends</b> to bring <b>a large offering</b> of eighty loaves, and therefore none of the loaves are consecrated.<br><b>Abaye said: They only taught</b> Rav’s ruling that one cannot establish residence beneath a tree without precisely defining a particular location, <b>with regard to a tree beneath which there are</b> at least <b>twelve cubits. However, with regard to a tree</b> beneath <b>which there are not twelve cubits,</b> he can establish residence there, <b>as</b> at least <b>part of his residence is conspicuous.</b> In that case, there is a partial overlap between the middle four cubits beneath the tree and the four cubits nearest him and the four cubits farthest from him, and consequently each necessarily contains at least part of his residence.<br><b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, strongly objects to this: From where</b> is it ascertained <b>that he designates</b> his residence <b>in the four middle</b> cubits, so that there is a partial overlap with both the nearest and the farthest cubits; <b>perhaps he designates</b> it in <b>the four</b> cubits <b>on this side or</b> in <b>the four</b> cubits <b>on the other side?</b> Since he does not know which location he designated as his residence, he did not establish residence anywhere beneath the tree.<br><b>Rather, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> Abaye’s statement must be emended. <b>They taught</b> this <b>only with regard to a tree that</b> has at least <b>eight cubits beneath it. However, with regard to a tree that</b> has only <b>seven cubits beneath it,</b> even if one did not establish a particular location, he acquires residence, <b>as</b> at least <b>part of his residence is conspicuous,</b> as any four cubits must include at least one cubit of his residence.<br>With regard to the dispute between Rav and Shmuel, the Gemara notes that one <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> and another <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b><br>The Gemara elaborates. A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> With regard to <b>one who was coming along the way</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling, <b>and he was familiar</b> with <b>a tree or a fence</b> within two thousand cubits of his current location, <b>and he said: My residence is beneath</b> that tree, <b>he has not said anything</b> of legal consequence. <b>However, if he said: My residence is in such-and-such place, he walks until he reaches that place.</b> Once <b>he reached that place</b> that he established as his residence, <b>he walks</b> through <b>all of it and</b> another <b>two thousand cubits beyond it.</b><br><b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> that he establishes four cubits as his residence, and another two thousand cubits in each direction, <b>stated?</b> In a case where he selected <b>a</b> well-<b>defined,</b> clearly demarcated <b>place,</b> i.e., a case <b>where he established</b> residence <b>on a mound ten handbreadths high, and its</b> area ranges <b>from</b> a minimum of <b>four cubits to</b> a maximum of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>.</b><br><b>And, likewise,</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> when he establishes residence on <b>a plain ten</b> handbreadths <b>deeper</b> than the surrounding area, <b>and its</b> area ranges <b>from</b> a minimum of <b>four cubits to</b> a maximum of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>. However,</b> if he selected <b>a place that is not defined,</b> e.g., in the middle of a plain, he does not establish residence, and accordingly <b>he has only four cubits</b> in which to move.<br><b>If two</b> people <b>were</b> walking together, <b>one</b> of whom is <b>familiar</b> with a particular location in the distance, <b>and one</b> of whom is <b>not familiar</b> with it, <b>the one who</b> is <b>not familiar</b> with it <b>entrusts</b> his right to designate <b>his</b> residence <b>to the one</b> who is <b>familiar</b> with it, <b>and the one who</b> is <b>familiar</b> with it <b>says: My residence is in such-and-such place.</b><br><b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> that he acquires four cubits as his residence and another two thousand cubits in each direction, <b>stated?</b> In a case <b>where he defined</b> the <b>four cubits that he</b> seeks to <b>establish</b> as his residence. <b>However,</b> if <b>he did not define</b> the <b>four cubits that he</b> seeks to <b>establish</b> as his residence, <b>he may not move from his</b> current <b>place,</b> as neither did he seek to establish residence there, nor did he acquire it in the location he sought to establish residence. This <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav that one who fails to designate the four cubits he seeks to establish as residence has no residence at all.<br>Gemara poses a question: <b>Let us say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is a <b>conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara answers: There is no difficulty, as <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a</b> special <b>case, where from the place he is standing to the trunk</b> of the tree <b>there is</b> a distance of <b>two thousand and four cubits, so that if you were to establish</b> residence <b>on the other side of the tree, it would be situated outside</b> his Shabbat limit.<br>Consequently, <b>if he designated</b> his <b>four cubits</b> on the near side of the tree <b>he may go</b> there; <b>and if not, he may not go</b> from the place he is standing. In other words, since he did not establish residence in a particular location, the concern is that he sought to establish it beyond his two thousand cubit limit.<br>A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. If one erred and established an <i>eiruv</i> in two directions</b> at once, for example, if in his ignorance <b>he imagined that</b> it is permitted to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> in two directions,</b> that he may extend the distance that he may walk on Shabbat in two opposite directions, <b>or if he said to his servants: Go out and establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me,</b> without specifying the direction, and <b>one established an <i>eiruv</i> for him to the north, and one established an <i>eiruv</i> for him to the south, he may walk to the north as</b> far as he is permitted go based on <b>his <i>eiruv</i> to the south,</b> and he may walk <b>to the south as</b> far as he is permitted go based on <b>his <i>eiruv</i> to the north.</b> In other words, the assumption is that he established residence in both directions based on the <i>eiruv</i> in each direction, and he must therefore take both into consideration before moving.<br><b>And</b> consequently, <b>if</b> each <i>eiruv</i> was placed two thousand cubits in opposite directions <b>placing him in the middle of the limit, he may not move from his</b> current <b>location,</b> as it is prohibited to venture beyond either limit. Apparently, even if one did not establish residence in a particular location, as in this case he has acquired residence in both places, nonetheless, the <i>halakha</i> is that residence has been established in his current location, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.<br>The Gemara poses a question: <b>Let us say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is a <b>conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> indeed differs with Rav’s ruling. Nevertheless, his opinion is not disqualified, as <b>Rav himself</b> had <b><i>tanna</i></b> status and therefore, unlike later <i>amora’im</i>, could <b>disagree </b>with opinions of <i>tanna’im</i>.<br>We learned in the mishna that if, however, <b>he said: My residence is at</b> the <b>trunk</b> of the tree, he established residence there, and he <b>may walk from the place that he is standing to the trunk</b> of the tree, up to <b>two thousand cubits, and from the trunk</b> of the tree <b>to his house</b> another <b>two thousand cubits. Ultimately, he may walk after nightfall</b> a total distance of <b>four thousand cubits.</b><br><br></body></html>
