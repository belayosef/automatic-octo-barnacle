Daf 23a<br><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava. And Rav Yosef</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a <b>well were permitted only in</b> the case of <b>a well</b> containing potable, running <b>spring water.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary</b> to cite both of these statements, even though their content appears to be the same. <b>As had</b> he <b>taught us</b> only that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava</b> that upright boards may only be set arranged for a well, <b>I would have said</b> that with regard to water belonging to <b>the public,</b> upright boards are permitted not only in the case of spring water, but <b>even</b> in the case of water <b>collected</b> in a cistern.<br><b>And that which was taught:</b> One may only arrange boards for <b>a public well,</b> that was <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva</b> that upright boards may be arranged even for a private well, but not to allow us to infer that boards may not be arranged for a public cistern filled with collected water. Therefore, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that <b>boards</b> surrounding a <b>well were permitted only</b> in the case of <b>a well of spring water.</b><br><b>And</b> in the opposite direction, <b>had</b> he <b>taught us</b> that upright boards may only be arranged for <b>a well</b> containing potable, running <b>spring water, I would have said</b> that <b>there is no difference</b> whether it is a <b>public</b> well <b>and there is no difference</b> whether it is a <b>private</b> well. Shmuel therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava,</b> who says that upright boards may be arranged only for a public well, but not for one that belongs to an individual.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava said:</b> With regard to <b>a garden or a <i>karpef</i>,</b> an enclosed courtyard used for storage, <b>that is</b> not more than <b>seventy cubits and a remainder,</b> a little more, as will be explained below, <b>by seventy cubits and a remainder, and is surrounded by a wall ten handbreadths high, one may carry inside it,</b> as it constitutes a proper private domain. This is <b>provided that it contains a watchman’s booth or a dwelling place, or it is near the town</b> in which its owner lives, so that he uses it and it is treated like a dwelling.<br><b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This is not necessary, for <b>even if it contains only a</b> water <b>cistern, an</b> elongated water <b>ditch, or a cave,</b> i.e., a covered pit containing water, <b>one may carry inside it,</b> as the water bestows upon it the status of a dwelling. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even if it has none of these one may carry inside it, provided that it measures</b> not more than <b>seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder.</b><br><b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If its length is greater than its breadth, even by one cubit, one may not carry inside it,</b> even though its total area does not exceed an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, because in an area that was enclosed not for the purpose of residence, carrying is only permitted if the area is perfectly square. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if its length is double its breadth, one may carry inside it,</b> and there is no need to be particular about a square shape.<br><b>Rabbi Elai said: I heard from Rabbi Eliezer</b> that one is permitted to carry in a garden or <i>karpef</i>, <b>even</b> if the garden <b>is</b> an area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> i.e., thirty times larger than the area of a <i>beit se’a</i>.<br>Incidentally, he adds: <b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>: If <b>one of the residents of a courtyard forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents when they established an <i>eiruv</i>, and on Shabbat he ceded ownership of his part in the courtyard to the other residents, then it <b>is prohibited for him,</b> the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>to bring in</b> objects <b>or take</b> them <b>out</b> from <b>his house</b> to the courtyard; <b>however, it is permitted to them,</b> the other residents, to bring objects from their houses to that person’s house via the courtyard, and vice versa. We do not say that the failure of one resident to join in the <i>eiruv</i> nullifies the validity of the <i>eiruv</i> for the entire courtyard.<br><b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that one may fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover with <i>arkablin</i>,</b> a certain bitter herb. With regard to all three rulings, <b>I circulated among all</b> of Rabbi Eliezer’s <b>disciples, seeking a colleague</b> who had also heard these matters from him, <b>but I could not find</b> one.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara first analyzes the wording of this mishna: <b>What was taught</b> previously, <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in this mishna: <b>And furthermore</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava said, which implies a continuation of the previous mishna?<br><b>If you say</b> that <b>because he</b> first <b>taught one stringency</b> concerning the upright boards surrounding a well, <b>and</b> then <b>he teaches another</b> stringency about an enclosure, and <b>for that reason</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches: And furthermore,</b> then there is a difficulty. <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yehuda</b> also <b>teach one stringency and</b> then <b>teach another</b> stringency, <b>and</b> yet the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not teach: And furthermore</b> Rabbi Yehuda said?<br>The Gemara answers that the cases are different: <b>There, the Rabbis interrupted</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s statements in order to disagree with him, and hence it is not possible to say: And furthermore Rabbi Yehuda said. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>the Rabbis did not interrupt him,</b> as the two statements of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava immediately follow one another.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: Does this mean that <b>wherever the</b> disputing <b>Rabbis interrupt</b> their colleague, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: And furthermore? But</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> in a mishna <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Sukka</i></b> (27a), <b>where the Rabbis interrupted his</b> statements, nonetheless the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: And furthermore.</b><br>The Gemara answers: It is not the same; <b>there, they interrupted</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>with</b> a ruling with regard to <b>his</b> own <b>topic; here,</b> however, <b>they interrupted</b> Rabbi Yehuda with a ruling with regard to <b>an</b> altogether <b>different matter.</b> Consequently, his first statement had already been forgotten, and it is not the Mishna’s style to join together statements where the sequential link between them has already been severed.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Akiva said: Even</b> if the courtyard <b>has none of these</b> elements that indicate dwelling stipulated by the other Rabbis, <b>one may carry inside it,</b> provided that it measures no more than seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder.<br><br>Daf 23b<br><br>The Gemara asks: But the view of <b>Rabbi Akiva is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, who maintains that in the case of a garden that was not enclosed for the purpose of residence, one is only permitted to carry if the area of the enclosed area is no more than two <i>beit se’a</i>. Rabbi Akiva disagrees only about whether we require a watchman’s booth or a dwelling place as well, but the two agree with regard to the size of the garden. Therefore, Rabbi Akiva’s stipulation: Provided that it measures not more than seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder, is superfluous.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>a tiny amount.</b> And what is this tiny amount? It is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is by <b>a tiny amount</b> that one of the sides of a square measuring two <i>beit se’a</i> <b>exceeds seventy cubits and a remainder, but the Sages did not give its</b> exact <b>measurement,</b> owing to its small size and because it is impossible to be absolutely precise about the matter.<br><b>And what is</b> the <b>measure</b> of the area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>?</b> It is as large <b>as the courtyard of the Tabernacle,</b> which was fifty cubits by one hundred cubits. The first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Akiva dispute this issue: The first <i>tanna</i> maintains that the garden may have an area as large as two <i>beit se’a</i>, whereas Rabbi Akiva says that it must not exceed seventy and two-thirds cubits squared.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters derived?</b> The matters referred to are that we must square the courtyard of the Tabernacle in order to reach the size of garden or similar enclosure in which one is permitted to carry on Shabbat.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is learned from <b>the verse</b> that <b>stated: “The length of the courtyard shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty,</b> and the height, five cubits of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass” (Exodus 27:18). <b>The Torah said: Take</b> a square of <b>fifty</b> cubits by fifty cubits, <b>and surround</b> it with the remaining <b>fifty</b> cubits until they form a square, each side of which measures seventy cubits and a remainder.<br>The Gemara asks: But <b>to what does the plain meaning of the verse refer?</b> The plain sense of the text cannot be coming to teach us the laws of carrying. <b>Abaye said</b> that it means as follows: The Tabernacle was thirty cubits long and ten cubits wide. The courtyard was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. <b>Position the Tabernacle</b> in the middle of the courtyard <b>at the edge of fifty</b> cubits, <b>so that there is</b> a space of <b>fifty cubits in front of it, and</b> a space of <b>twenty cubits in every direction,</b> on each of the two sides and behind it.<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If its length is</b> greater than its breadth, even by one cubit, one may not carry inside it. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If its length is more than double its breadth, even by one cubit, one may not carry inside it?</b><br><b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: When we learned</b> this <b>in the mishna,</b> we <b>also</b> learned that it refers to a case where the length of the enclosure is <b>more than double its breadth.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who stated that one is permitted to carry in the garden or <i>karpef</i> even if its length is double its width.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>the square that the Sages squared it,</b> because the Sages calculated squares with the diagonal. According to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, if the diagonal is more than double the breadth, even though the length may not be more than double the breadth, it is prohibited to carry within the enclosure. According to Rabbi Yosei, however, it is permitted (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).<br>We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Even if its length is double its breadth, one may carry inside it. <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed on the following matter: <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. And Rav Beivai said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b><br>The Gemara explains that <b>both</b> rulings <b>are</b> stated <b>leniently, and</b> that both were <b>necessary. As had</b> the Gemara <b>taught</b> only that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, I would have said</b> that one is not permitted to carry <b>unless</b> the place <b>contains a watchman’s booth or a dwelling place,</b> for Rabbi Yosei did not specify that these are not required. Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Akiva,</b> who is particular only about the courtyard’s size, but not that it be enclosed for the purpose of residence.<br><b>And,</b> on the other hand, <b>had</b> the Gemara <b>taught</b> only that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, I would have said</b> that if the courtyard is <b>long and narrow,</b> one is <b>not</b> permitted to carry. Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who clearly states that the courtyard need not be square.<br>The Sages taught: Within <b>a <i>karpef</i> that is greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> but <b>which was enclosed</b> from the outset <b>for the purpose of residence,</b> carrying is permitted regardless of its size; however, if subsequently <b>the greater part of it was sown</b> with seed crops, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like a garden,</b> which is not a place of dwelling, <b>and it is prohibited</b> to carry anything within it.<br>However, if <b>the greater part of it was planted</b> with trees, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like a courtyard,</b> which is a place of dwelling, <b>and</b> one <b>is permitted</b> to carry. The reason for this distinction is that the presence of trees does not nullify the status of the <i>karpef</i> as a place of residence, because people normally plant trees even in their courtyards. However, people ordinarily plant seed crops only in gardens at some distance from their houses, in places they do not use for dwelling; therefore, the presence of seed crops does nullify the residential status of the <i>karpef</i>.<br>It was stated above that if <b>the greater part of</b> the <i>karpef</i> <b>was sown</b> with seed crops, it is prohibited to carry in it. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: We only said</b> this in a case where the sown section is <b>greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>, but</b> if it is no more than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b><br>The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this stated? It was stated <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs, courtyards, and <i>karpeifot</i> are all one domain with regard to utensils that began Shabbat in them,</b> even if the utensils belong to different people. Since these are not proper dwelling places, setting an <i>eiruv</i> is unnecessary, and objects may be carried from place to place within them. But they are <b>not</b> one domain <b>with regard to utensils that began Shabbat in the house</b> and that were later taken outside. This shows that the unsown part of a <i>karpef</i> and the sown part, which has the status of a garden, are considered a single domain, in which one is permitted to carry, as the garden section does not prohibit the <i>karpef</i> section.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, since the greater part of</b> the <i>karpef</i> <b>is sown, the minor</b> part<br><br></body></html>
