Daf 94a<br><br><b>This</b> one <b>may carry to the base of the</b> former <b>partition, and that</b> one <b>may</b> likewise <b>carry to the base of the partition,</b> as he maintains that since it was permitted at the beginning of Shabbat, it remains permitted until the conclusion of Shabbat.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> ruling <b>of Rav was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference;</b> i.e., it was inferred by his students from another one of his teachings. As once <b>Rav and Shmuel were sitting in a certain courtyard</b> on Shabbat, and <b>the wall between</b> the two courtyards <b>fell. Shmuel said to</b> the people around him: <b>Take a cloak</b> and <b>suspend it on</b> the remnant of the partition.<br><b>Rav turned his face away,</b> displaying his displeasure with Shmuel’s opinion, as Rav maintained it was prohibited to carry a cloak in this courtyard. <b>Shmuel said to them</b> in a humorous vein: <b>If Abba,</b> Rav, <b>is particular, take his belt</b> and <b>tie it</b> to the cloak, to secure it to the partition.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Shmuel, why was it necessary</b> to suspend the cloak? He himself <b>said:</b> If a wall between two courtyards collapsed on Shabbat, <b>this</b> one <b>may carry to the base of the</b> former <b>partition, and that</b> one <b>may</b> likewise <b>carry to the base of the partition.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> did not <b>do</b> so to render it permitted to carry in the courtyard. He did so <b>merely for</b> the purpose of <b>privacy,</b> as he did not want the residents of the other courtyard to see into his own courtyard.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav, if he maintains that</b> in this case carrying is <b>prohibited, he should have said</b> so <b>to him</b> explicitly. The Gemara answers: <b>It was Shmuel’s place.</b> Rav did not want to disagree with his colleague in his jurisdiction, as he accepted the opinion of the local authority.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if he accepted the jurisdiction of the local rabbinic authority, <b>why did he turn his face away?</b> The Gemara answers: He acted in this manner so <b>that</b> people would <b>not say</b> that <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, and</b> that <b>he retracted his</b> opinion with regard to this <b><i>halakha</i>.</b><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a courtyard that was breached into the public domain,</b> and the breach was more than ten cubits wide, so that it cannot be considered an entrance, <b>one who carries</b> an object <b>from inside</b> the courtyard <b>into the private domain, or from the private domain into it, is liable,</b> as it ceases to be a private domain and is subsumed into the public domain. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b><br><b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say:</b> One who carries <b>from inside</b> the courtyard <b>into the public domain, or from the public domain into it, is exempt, because its</b> legal status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a <i>karmelit</i>.</b> Although it ceases to be a private domain, it does not become a full-fledged public domain.<br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer, due to</b> the fact that the courtyard <b>was breached into the public domain,</b> does <b>it become the public domain?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> as in this regard the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning.</b><br><b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> In a situation where the <b>multitudes selected a path for themselves</b> in a field, or between fields, the path <b>that they selected, they selected,</b> and they retain the right to traverse this path even if the place belongs to an individual. Here too, as the partition of the courtyard was breached to the extent that the public can enter, its status is that of a public domain.<br>The Gemara expresses surprise at this opinion: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Giddel say</b> that <b>Rav said: And this</b> applies only <b>if they had misplaced a path in that field.</b> Generally speaking, the public does not have the right to establish a path wherever it chooses. The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where a public path used to run through that field, but it fell into disuse, and no one remembers its precise course. In this case the public may once again select a path through the field.<br><b>And if you say: Here too,</b> the mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the public <b>misplaced a path in that courtyard.</b> They do not remember the exact position of the partition that once separated the courtyard and the public domain. The public claims that the residents of the courtyard appropriated that part of their domain. It is only this area that Rabbi Eliezer says is considered a public domain. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is with regard to the entire courtyard <b>to [ad] the place of</b> the fallen <b>partition,</b> not only the small section that might have been a public path.<br>The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Say</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina stated that Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis <b>disagree over [<i>al</i>] the place of</b> the <b>partition,</b> i.e., the dispute does not concern the entire courtyard, but only the former location of the partition, where a public path might once have passed.<br><b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna is dealing with a case where the location of the original partition is known, and the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the legal status of <b>the sides of a public domain. As Rabbi Eliezer maintains</b> that <b>the sides of a public domain are considered like a public domain,</b> i.e., the areas adjacent to the public domain are subsumed into the public domain. The same applies to the place of the partition that once separated the courtyard and the public domain but was breached. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>the sides of a public domain are not considered like a public domain.</b><br>The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let them disagree with regard to the sides of a public domain in general;</b> why did they disagree about this particular case? The Gemara answers: <b>Had they disagreed with regard to the sides of a public domain in general, we would have said: When do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer? This</b> dispute <b>applies only where there are stakes</b> alongside the houses, which interfere with the use of the sides of the public domain. <b>However, where there are no</b> such <b>stakes, say</b> that <b>they concede to him</b> that the sides of a public domain are considered like a public domain. By formulating the dispute with regard to a courtyard that was breached into the public domain, the mishna is <b>teaching us</b> that they disagree in all cases.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>say</b> with regard to a courtyard that was breached into the public domain, that one who carries an object <b>from inside</b> the courtyard into the private domain is liable? Apparently, he is liable if he carries an article into the private domain from anywhere in the courtyard, not only from the area adjacent to the public domain, as the entire courtyard is considered a public domain.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>As the Rabbis said: From inside</b> the courtyard, Rabbi Eliezer <b>also said: From inside</b> the courtyard. No conclusion can be inferred from his use of the term, as he was referring only to the section adjacent to the public domain.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But,</b> if that is the case, the statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> is difficult. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> that the legal status of <b>the sides of the public domain</b> is like that of a public domain, <b>and they replied to him</b> by referring to: <b>From inside</b> the entire courtyard? They appear to be addressing two different cases.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>This is what the Rabbis are saying to Rabbi Eliezer: Don’t you concede to us</b> with regard to a case <b>where he carried</b> an object <b>from inside</b> the courtyard <b>to the public domain, or from the public domain to</b> the courtyard, <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt, because</b> the courtyard <b>is</b> considered <b>like a <i>karmelit</i>? The sides</b> of the public domain are <b>no different,</b> and should have the status of a <i>karmelit</i> <b>as well.</b><br><b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> counter this argument? <b>There, the public does not tread on</b> the courtyard; <b>here,</b> the <b>public treads on</b> the edge of the courtyard adjacent to the public domain, and therefore its status is that of a public domain in every sense.<br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a courtyard that was breached</b> on Shabbat <b>into a public domain from two</b> of <b>its sides, and likewise</b> with regard to <b>a house that was breached from two</b> of <b>its sides, and likewise</b> with regard to <b>an alleyway whose</b> cross <b>beams or side posts were removed</b> on Shabbat, the residents of that domain <b>are permitted</b> to carry there <b>on that Shabbat, but are prohibited</b> from doing so <b>in the future.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b><br><b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>if they are permitted</b> to carry there <b>on that Shabbat, they are</b> likewise <b>permitted</b> to do so <b>in the future, and if they are prohibited</b> from carrying there <b>in the future, they are</b> also <b>prohibited</b> from carrying there <b>on that Shabbat.</b><br><strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing? If you say</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the breach was up to <b>ten</b> cubits wide, in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> a breach <b>on</b> only <b>one side different?</b> It is due to the fact <b>that we say: It is an entrance</b> rather than a breach, and carrying is therefore permitted. If so, if it was breached <b>on two sides as well,</b> say: <b>It is an entrance,</b> and there are entrances on two sides of the courtyard. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is certainly dealing <b>with</b> a breach that is <b>greater than ten</b> cubits. <b>If so,</b> it should be prohibited to carry <b>even</b> if the courtyard was breached <b>on</b> only <b>one side,</b> as a breach that size negates all the partitions.<br><b>Rav said: Actually,</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a breach that is no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits,<br><br>Daf 94b<br><br><b>and</b> with a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>was breached in a corner,</b> so that it is breached on two sides. Although the opening is no more than ten cubits wide, it cannot be considered an entrance, <b>as people do not build an entrance in a corner.</b> It is therefore clear that this is a breach that negates the partition.<br>We learned in the mishna: <b>And likewise,</b> with regard to <b>a house that was breached</b> on Shabbat <b>from two of its sides</b> into a public domain, the residents are permitted to carry in the house on that Shabbat, but not a future Shabbat. The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> a breach <b>on one side different?</b> The difference is due to the fact <b>that we say: The edge of the roof descends and seals</b> the house, as if there were a full-fledged partition there. <b>So too,</b> when it is breached <b>on two sides, let us say: The edge of the roof descends and seals.</b><br>The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the house <b>was breached in a corner, and its roofing was inclined, as</b> in that case, <b>one cannot say: The edge of the roof descends and seals,</b> as the edge of an inclined roof does not appear to be the beginning of a partition.<br><b>And Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is referring to a breach that is <b>even wider than ten</b> cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did the mishna cite a case where it is breached from two sides? It should be prohibited to carry there <b>even</b> if it were breached <b>from one side.</b><br>The Gemara answers: The reason that it is prohibited only if it is breached from two sides is <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b>a house.</b> In the case of a courtyard, the same <i>halakha</i> would apply even if it were breached on only one side. However, the mishna sought to teach the <i>halakha</i> of a house as well, in which case, it is prohibited to carry only if it is breached on two sides. If it is breached on one side, the edge of the roof descends and seals, and carrying is permitted.<br>The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a house itself should pose a difficulty</b> according to this explanation. In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> a breach <b>on one side different?</b> It is due to the fact <b>that we say: The edge of the roof descends and seals</b> the house, as if there were a full-fledged partition there. <b>So too,</b> when it is breached <b>on two sides, let us say: The edge of the roof descends and seals.</b><br><b>And furthermore: Is Shmuel of</b> the opinion that there is a principle: <b>The edge of a roof descends and seals? But wasn’t it stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to a <b>portico</b> located <b>in a valley,</b> which has the status of a <i>karmelit</i>. <b>Rav said:</b> It <b>is permitted to carry in the entire</b> portico, as he maintains that the edge of the roof of the portico descends and seals, rendering it a private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four cubits.</b> Apparently, Shmuel does not accept the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals.<br>The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not a difficulty. Where</b> Shmuel <b>is not of</b> the opinion that this principle is applied, it is <b>with regard to</b> a structure where walls on all <b>four</b> sides are formed in that manner. <b>However, with regard to</b> a structure where only <b>three</b> sides are formed in that manner and the fourth side is an actual wall, <b>he is of</b> the opinion that the principle is applied.<br>The Gemara comments: <b>In any case,</b> this is <b>difficult.</b> Although the contradiction between the two statements of Shmuel was resolved, the question remains: Why do we not apply the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals, to two sides of the house?<br>The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>as the</b> Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the house <b>was breached in a corner, and its roofing was inclined,</b> as in that case, one cannot say: The roof of the house descends and seals. <b>Here too,</b> Shmuel’s opinion can be explained in a similar manner: The mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the house <b>was breached in a corner, and its roof is</b> at a distance <b>of</b> at least <b>four</b> handbreadths from the breach, and is uneven. In that case, the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals, would have to be applied to four corners, and Shmuel is of the opinion that it may not be applied in that case.<br>The Gemara explains: <b>Shmuel did not say</b> his explanation of the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> that the roof was <b>slanted,</b> which is the crux of Rav’s explanation. <b>And Rav did not say</b> his explanation of the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> as <b>if so,</b> even if the roof was breached on several sides, <b>its</b> legal status would be that of <b>a portico, and Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said:</b> With regard to <b>a portico, it is permitted to carry throughout the entire</b> portico.<br>The Gemara proceeds to cite the dispute between Rav and Shmuel in a more comprehensive manner. <b>As it was stated</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It <b>is permitted to carry in the entire</b> portico as it is considered sealed. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four cubits.</b> As the portico does not have actual partitions it is subsumed into the field, and shares its status of a <i>karmelit</i>.<br>The Gemara elaborates on their respective opinions. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to carry in the entire</b> portico, as he maintains that <b>we say: The edge of the roof descends and seals</b> the portico to form a partition. As there is a roof over the portico, it is considered sealed with partitions on all four sides. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four cubits,</b> as <b>we do not say: The edge of the ceiling descends and seals.</b><br>The Gemara elaborates further: If the openings on the sides of the portico are no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits, <b>everyone agrees</b> that they are considered sealed, as the status of even an unroofed breach of ten cubits or less is that of an entrance, and one is permitted to carry throughout the entire domain. <b>They disagree</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the openings are <b>more than ten</b> cubits wide.<br><b>And some say:</b> On the contrary, if the openings are <b>more</b> than ten cubits wide, <b>everyone agrees</b> that they are considered breaches, and the principle: The edge of the roof descends and seals, is not applied. <b>They disagree</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the openings are no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits.<br><b>And that which Rav Yehuda said:</b><br><br></body></html>
